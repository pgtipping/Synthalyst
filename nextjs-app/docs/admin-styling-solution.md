# Admin Module CSS Loading Solution

## Issue Summary

The admin module was experiencing CSS loading issues due to:

1. Global CSS imports in client components
2. Styled-jsx conflicts with Next.js server components
3. Import order dependencies causing inconsistent styling

## Solution Implemented

We've implemented a robust and maintainable approach for admin module styling:

### 1. Dedicated CSS Files

- Created `admin-core.css` containing self-contained styles for admin components
- Moved the file to the `styles` directory to follow Next.js conventions
- Imported the core CSS into the main `admin.css` file using standard CSS imports

### 2. Server Component Compatibility

- Removed styled-jsx from server components (layout.tsx) to avoid "client-only" errors
- Moved inline styles to external CSS files
- Used standard CSS and CSS variables for theming

### 3. CSS Organization

- Organized styles into modules:
  - `admin.css`: Main admin styles and variables
  - `admin-core.css`: Component-specific styles
- Used prefixed classnames (e.g., `admin-*`) to prevent conflicts

### 4. Client-Side Scripts

- Added a small client-side script to set body class for global styling
- Used React Fragment syntax to properly render the script tag

## Benefits

- Modular approach allows for better organization and maintenance
- No dependency on import order
- Consistent styling across admin components
- Better separation of concerns
- Compatibility with Next.js server components

## Usage Guidelines

1. Use the `admin-*` prefixed classes for admin components
2. Add new admin styles to the appropriate CSS file:
   - Component-specific styles → `admin-core.css`
   - Global admin variables and styles → `admin.css`
3. Import styles only in layout files, not in components

## Next Steps

1. Continue migrating inline styles to CSS files
2. Further refine the responsive design for mobile views
3. Create a theme switcher for light/dark mode
4. Consider a CSS-in-JS solution that works with Server Components

## Known Issues

The build process currently fails with an unrelated error regarding the `useToast` hook in the interview prep section. This needs to be addressed separately.
