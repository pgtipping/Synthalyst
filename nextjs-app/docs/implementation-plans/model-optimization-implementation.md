# Model Optimization Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for a cost-optimized combination strategy for the Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator features. The goal is to use the most appropriate models for each task while optimizing for cost and quality.

## Model Selection Strategy

### Primary Models

1. **Knowledge GPT**: Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B

   - Lower cost (0.0375/input, 0.15/output for â‰¤128K tokens)
   - Good for summarization and multilingual support
   - Low latency for responsive user experience

2. **Learning Creator**: GPT-4o-Mini
   - Balanced cost-to-capability ratio (0.15/input, 0.6/output)
   - Strong content generation and complex reasoning
   - Good multilingual support

### Tiered Approach

We've implemented a tiered approach that selects the appropriate model based on:

1. **Task Complexity**:

   - Low complexity: Prefer cheaper models
   - Medium complexity: Use default models
   - High complexity: Use more capable models

2. **Content Length**:

   - Short content: Prefer cheaper models
   - Long content: Use more capable models

3. **Language Support**:

   - If language is supported by Gemini: Use Gemini
   - If language is not supported by Gemini: Fall back to GPT-4o-Mini

4. **Cost Priority**:
   - If cost is prioritized: Prefer cheaper models when possible
   - If quality is prioritized: Use more capable models

## Implementation Details

### Model Router

We've created a model router service in `/lib/ai/model-router.ts` that:

1. Defines model aliases and supported languages
2. Provides functions to select the appropriate model based on parameters
3. Handles API calls to both OpenAI and Google AI
4. Detects task complexity and language
5. Creates multilingual system prompts

### API Integration

1. **Knowledge GPT API** (`/api/knowledge-gpt/route.ts`):

   - Uses the model router to select the appropriate model
   - Adds language support to the API
   - Stores the model used in the database

2. **Learning Content API** (`/api/learning-content/route.ts`):
   - Uses the model router to select the appropriate model
   - Adds language support to the API
   - Stores the model used in the database

### UI Enhancements

1. **Language Selector Component** (`/components/ui/language-selector.tsx`):

   - Allows users to select their preferred language
   - Shows supported languages for each model
   - Detects browser language as default

2. **Knowledge GPT Page** (`/app/knowledge-gpt/page.tsx`):

   - Adds language selection
   - Improves the UI for better user experience

3. **Learning Creator Page** (`/app/learning-content/page.tsx`):
   - Adds language selection
   - Improves the UI for better user experience

## Database Schema Updates

We've updated the database schema to include:

1. **Language Field**:

   - Added to KnowledgeEntry and LearningContentEntry models
   - Defaults to "English"
   - Used for filtering and display

## Cost Optimization

### Expected Savings

Based on our implementation, we expect:

1. **Knowledge GPT**:

   - 70-80% cost reduction for most queries
   - Fall back to GPT-4o-Mini only for complex queries or unsupported languages

2. **Learning Creator**:
   - 30-40% cost reduction for simple content
   - Use GPT-4o-Mini for complex content generation

### Monitoring and Adjustment

To ensure optimal cost-quality balance:

1. **Usage Tracking**:

   - Track model usage and costs
   - Analyze patterns to identify optimization opportunities

2. **Quality Monitoring**:

   - Collect user feedback on output quality
   - Adjust complexity thresholds based on feedback

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Regularly update the model router with new models
   - Refine the selection algorithm based on performance data

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Test with various languages and complexity levels
   - Validate cost savings and output quality

2. **User Feedback**:

   - Collect feedback on multilingual support
   - Adjust based on user preferences

3. **Analytics**:

   - Implement analytics to track model usage
   - Use data to further optimize the selection algorithm

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update documentation for developers
   - Create user guides for language selection

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a cost-effective approach to using AI models while maintaining high-quality outputs. By dynamically selecting the appropriate model based on task requirements, we can optimize costs without sacrificing quality.
