# Using Mistral 7B in Place of the Text-Davinci Model

## Installation

It is recommended to use [`mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3`](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3) with `mistral-inference`. For Hugging Face transformers code snippets, please keep scrolling.

```bash
pip install mistral_inference
```

## Download

```python
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
from pathlib import Path

mistral_models_path = Path.home().joinpath('mistral_models', '7B-v0.3')
mistral_models_path.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

snapshot_download(
    repo_id="mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3",
    allow_patterns=["params.json", "consolidated.safetensors", "tokenizer.model.v3"],
    local_dir=mistral_models_path
)
```

## Demo

After installing `mistral_inference`, a `mistral-demo` CLI command should be available in your environment.

```bash
mistral-demo $HOME/mistral_models/7B-v0.3
```

This should output something along the following lines:

```txt
This is a test of the emergency broadcast system. This is only a test.

If this were a real emergency, you would be told what to do.

This is another test of the new blogging software. I’m not sure if I’m going to keep it or not. I’m not sure if I’m going to keep

This is a third test, mistral AI is very good at testing. 🙂

## Generate with Transformers

If you want to use Hugging Face Transformers to generate text, you can do something like this:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_id = "mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.3"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id)
inputs = tokenizer("Hello my name is", return_tensors="pt")

outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=20)
print(tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

## Limitations

The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance. It does not include any moderation mechanisms.

You can build your own moderation mechanism by combining several strategies:

### Rule-based Filtering

Create a list of prohibited words or patterns (e.g. profanity, hate speech, or inappropriate topics) and scan the generated text for these. You can use regular expressions or string matching to flag or reject problematic content.

### Contextual Scoring with a Classifier

Train or use an off‑the‑shelf text classifier that labels outputs as “safe” or “unsafe.” This classifier can be built using supervised learning on a curated dataset of moderated examples. For example, you might use a simple logistic regression or fine‑tune a smaller transformer model to perform content moderation.

### Human-in-the-Loop Review

For high-risk applications, you could include a step where outputs flagged by automated checks are sent for human review.

### Prompt Engineering Guardrails

Adjust your prompt to instruct the model to generate content that adheres to certain guidelines (e.g. “Generate curriculum content that is factual, neutral, and free of any offensive language”). This doesn’t replace moderation but can reduce the risk of unwanted outputs.

Below is a simple Python example that uses a rule‑based approach along with a basic classifier from the Hugging Face Transformers library. In this sample, we’ll assume you already have a function that generates text from your LLM:

```python
import re
from transformers import pipeline

# List of banned words or phrases
BANNED_PATTERNS = [
    r"\b(?:offensive_word1|offensive_word2)\b",  # add words here
    r"some sensitive phrase",
]

def rule_based_filter(text: str) -> bool:
    """Return True if text passes the filter, False if it contains banned content."""
    for pattern in BANNED_PATTERNS:
        if re.search(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE):
            return False
    return True

# Example: load a sentiment classifier for moderation purposes (you could train your own)
moderation_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="unitary/toxic-bert")

def classifier_filter(text: str, threshold: float = 0.8) -> bool:
    """
    Use a pre-trained classifier to detect toxicity.
    Returns True if the text is safe, False if toxicity exceeds the threshold.
    """
    results = moderation_classifier(text)
    # Example result: [{'label': 'toxic', 'score': 0.95}]
    for result in results:
        if result['label'].lower() == 'toxic' and result['score'] > threshold:
            return False
    return True

def moderate_text(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Run both rule-based and classifier-based filters.
    Returns True if text is considered safe.
    """
    if not rule_based_filter(text):
        print("Rule-based filter flagged the content.")
        return False
    if not classifier_filter(text):
        print("Classifier-based filter flagged the content.")
        return False
    return True

# Sample function that generates text from an LLM
def generate_text(prompt: str) -> str:
    # Replace this with your actual LLM call
    generated = "Sample generated curriculum text with potential offensive_word1"
    return generated

def get_safe_generated_text(prompt: str) -> str:
    generated = generate_text(prompt)
    if moderate_text(generated):
        return generated
    else:
        return "The generated content was flagged as inappropriate. Please try a different prompt."

# Example usage:
prompt = "Generate a detailed training curriculum for data science."
safe_output = get_safe_generated_text(prompt)
print(safe_output)
```

### Explanation

- **Rule-based Filter:**  
  The `rule_based_filter` function uses regular expressions to check for banned words or phrases.

- **Classifier Filter:**  
  The `classifier_filter` function uses a pre-trained model (in this case, `"unitary/toxic-bert"`) to classify text for toxicity. You can adjust the threshold as needed.

- **Moderate Text:**  
  The `moderate_text` function combines both checks.

- **Integration:**  
  In `get_safe_generated_text`, the text generated by your LLM is passed through moderation. If it’s flagged, you return a safe message or take another action.

This sample provides a starting point; depending on your requirements, you might want to extend the banned patterns, train a custom classifier on your domain-specific data, or implement additional post‑processing steps.
