# Training Plan Creator Implementation Guide

## Overview

The Training Plan Creator is a tool that helps users create detailed, structured training plans for various learning objectives. This guide outlines the implementation approach for enhancing the existing Training Plan Creator with improved LLM integration and user experience.

## Current Implementation Status

The current implementation has:

- A form-based interface for creating training plans
- Two separate approaches to plan generation:
  - Direct LLM generation via `/api/training-plan/route.ts`
  - Programmatic generation via `/api/training-plan/generate/route.ts`
- Basic template and saved plan management
- Limited LLM integration in the main workflow

## Implementation Goals

1. Simplify the user interface to focus on essential inputs
2. Enhance LLM integration for richer, more contextual content
3. Improve resource recommendations with up-to-date information
4. Create a more intuitive user experience with helpful guidance

## Form Redesign

### Mandatory vs. Optional Fields

**Mandatory Fields:**

- Title (for identification)
- Learning Objectives (the core of what the plan aims to achieve)
- Target Audience Level (to tailor content appropriately)
- Duration (to structure the plan's scope)

**Optional Fields with Tooltips:**

- Description: "Adding a detailed description helps the AI understand the context and purpose of your training plan."
- Prerequisites: "Specifying prerequisites helps tailor content to the right knowledge level and ensures learners are prepared."
- Learning Style Preferences: "Indicating preferred learning styles helps create activities that match how your audience learns best."
- Industry/Domain: "Specifying your industry helps the AI generate more relevant examples and terminology."

### Simplified Form Structure

```
Basic Information:
- Title*
- Learning Objectives* (text area)
- Target Audience Level* (simple radio buttons: Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
- Duration* (simple input with unit selector)

[+ Advanced Options] (expandable section)
  - Description
  - Prerequisites
  - Learning Style Preferences
  - Industry/Domain
  - Materials Required
  - Certification Details
```

### Implementation Steps

1. Update `PlanForm.tsx` to simplify the form structure:

   - Reduce the number of visible fields
   - Implement a progressive disclosure pattern for advanced options
   - Replace restrictive dropdowns with free-text fields where appropriate

2. Modify the Zod schema in both the form and API to make most fields optional:

   ```typescript
   const formSchema = z.object({
     title: z.string().min(1, "Title is required"),
     objectives: z.string().min(1, "Learning objectives are required"),
     targetAudienceLevel: z
       .string()
       .min(1, "Target audience level is required"),
     duration: z.string().min(1, "Duration is required"),
     // All other fields optional
     description: z.string().optional(),
     prerequisites: z.string().optional(),
     // ...
   });
   ```

3. Add tooltip components with helpful guidance:
   ```tsx
   <FormItem>
     <FormLabel>Prerequisites</FormLabel>
     <FormControl>
       <Textarea {...field} />
     </FormControl>
     <FormDescription>
       <TooltipProvider>
         <Tooltip>
           <TooltipTrigger asChild>
             <InfoCircle className="h-4 w-4 inline-block ml-1" />
           </TooltipTrigger>
           <TooltipContent>
             <p>
               Specifying prerequisites helps tailor content to the right
               knowledge level.
             </p>
           </TooltipContent>
         </Tooltip>
       </TooltipProvider>
     </FormDescription>
     <FormMessage />
   </FormItem>
   ```

## Enhanced LLM Integration

### Two-Stage Approach

1. **Gemini + Search API Stage (Premium Users Only):**

   - Use Google's Gemini-2.0-flash model with the Search API to fetch current, relevant resources
   - Generate a structured list of up-to-date resources

2. **Llama 3.2 3b Instruct Model (All Users):**
   - Pass the core training plan parameters to meta-llama/Llama-3.2-3b-instruct model via the OpenRouter API
   - For premium users: Include the resource recommendations from Gemini as context
   - For free users: Use an enhanced prompt to request detailed resource recommendations
   - Generate the complete training plan with sections, activities, and assessments

### Implementation Steps

1. Create a new API endpoint that coordinates both models:

   ```typescript
   // /api/training-plan/enhanced-generate/route.ts
   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     try {
       // 1. Extract user input
       const body = await req.json();
       const validatedData = generatePlanSchema.parse(body);

       // 2. Check if user is premium
       const isPremiumUser = await checkUserSubscription(
         validatedData.userEmail
       );

       let resources = null;

       // 3. For premium users only: Fetch resources using Gemini + Search API
       if (isPremiumUser) {
         resources = await fetchResourcesWithGemini(validatedData);
       }

       // 4. Generate training plan with Llama using appropriate prompt
       const trainingPlan = await generatePlanWithLlama(
         validatedData,
         resources,
         isPremiumUser
       );

       // 5. Save to database and return
       // ...
     } catch (error) {
       // Error handling
     }
   }
   ```

2. Implement resource fetching with Gemini + Search API (premium users only):

   ```typescript
   async function fetchResourcesWithGemini(data: ValidatedData) {
     // Construct prompt for Gemini
     const prompt = `
       Find current and relevant learning resources for a training plan on:
       
       Title: ${data.title}
       Objectives: ${data.objectives.join(", ")}
       Target Audience Level: ${data.targetAudienceLevel}
       ${data.industry ? `Industry: ${data.industry}` : ""}
       
       Please provide a structured list of resources including:
       1. Books and articles (with publication dates)
       2. Online courses and tutorials
       3. Tools and software
       4. Communities and forums
       
       For each resource, include:
       - Title
       - Author/Creator
       - Publication date (if applicable)
       - URL (if available)
       - Brief description of relevance
       
       Format your response as a JSON array with the following structure:
       [
         {
           "id": "resource-1",
           "title": "Resource Title",
           "author": "Author Name",
           "type": "book|article|course|tool|community",
           "url": "https://example.com",
           "publicationDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
           "description": "Brief description of relevance",
           "relevanceScore": 85
         }
       ]
     `;

     // Call Gemini API with search capability
     // Process and structure the response
     // Return formatted resources
   }
   ```

3. Pass enriched context to Llama for final plan generation:

   ```typescript
   async function generatePlanWithLlama(
     data: ValidatedData,
     resources: Resources | null,
     isPremiumUser: boolean
   ) {
     // Base prompt for all users
     let prompt = `Create a detailed training plan based on:
       Title: ${data.title}
       Learning Objectives: ${data.objectives.join("\n")}
       Target Audience: ${data.targetAudienceLevel}
       Duration: ${data.duration}
       ${
         data.learningStylePrimary
           ? `Learning Style: ${data.learningStylePrimary}`
           : ""
       }
       
       Structure the plan with:
       1. Overview
       2. Detailed sections for each objective
       3. Activities aligned with learning styles
       4. Assessments
       5. Resource recommendations
     `;

     // For premium users: Include Gemini resources
     if (isPremiumUser && resources) {
       prompt += `
         Incorporate these current resources where appropriate:
         ${JSON.stringify(resources, null, 2)}
       `;
     }
     // For free users: Enhanced prompt for better resource recommendations
     else {
       prompt += `
         Include a comprehensive resources section with:
         
         1. Books and publications:
            - Include author names and publication years
            - Prioritize respected authors and foundational texts
            - Include both beginner and advanced options
         
         2. Online courses and tutorials:
            - Include platform names (Coursera, Udemy, YouTube, etc.)
            - Specify if they're free or paid when possible
            - Include estimated completion time when relevant
         
         3. Tools and software:
            - Specify which learning objectives they support
            - Include both free and commercial options
            - Note any special features relevant to the learning objectives
         
         4. Communities and forums:
            - Include online communities, forums, and discussion groups
            - Mention any regular meetups or conferences if applicable
            - Note which are most beginner-friendly
         
         Organize resources by difficulty level (beginner, intermediate, advanced) and relevance to specific learning objectives. For each resource, include a brief 1-2 sentence description explaining its value to the learner.
       `;
     }

     // Call openrouter API
     // Process and structure the response
     // Return formatted training plan
   }
   ```

4. Update the UI to highlight premium resources:

   ```tsx
   // In PlanList.tsx or similar component
   {
     plan.metadata.premiumResources && (
       <Badge variant="premium" className="ml-2">
         Premium
       </Badge>
     );
   }

   // When displaying resources
   {
     resource.isPremium && (
       <div className="premium-resource-badge">
         <SparklesIcon className="w-4 h-4 mr-1" />
         <span>AI-Curated</span>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```
