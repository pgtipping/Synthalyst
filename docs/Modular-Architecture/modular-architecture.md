# Synthalyst App Modular Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a modular architecture for the Synthalyst application. The modular approach separates the application into isolated modules with their own components, utilities, and API routes, while still allowing for shared code when necessary.

## Goals

1. **Isolation**: Each module should be able to function independently
2. **Scalability**: Allow the codebase to grow without increasing complexity
3. **Performance**: Enable module-specific building and optimization
4. **Maintainability**: Make the codebase easier to understand and maintain
5. **Deployment Stability**: Reduce deployment failures by allowing module-specific deployments

## Module Structure

Each module follows this structure:

```
src/app/(module-name)/
├── components/     # Module-specific components
├── lib/            # Module-specific utilities and helpers
├── styles/         # Module-specific styles
└── [routes]/       # Module-specific pages and API routes
```

## Modules Implemented

1. **Admin Module** (`src/app/(admin)/`)
   - Admin dashboard and related functionality
   - Blog management, user management, system monitoring, etc.

## Implementation Details

### Route Groups

We leverage Next.js route groups (using parentheses in the directory name) to organize our modules:

```
src/app/(admin)/   # Admin module
```

Route groups don't affect the URL path, allowing for clean URLs while maintaining code organization.

### Component Organization

Components are categorized into:

1. **Shared Components**: Located in `src/components/`
2. **Module-specific Components**: Located in `src/app/(module-name)/components/`

Example admin component import:

```tsx
// Shared component
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

// Admin-specific component
import { PostList } from "@/app/(admin)/components/blog/PostList";
```

### Module-specific Building

Each module can be built independently using custom build scripts:

- `scripts/build-admin.js`: Builds only the admin module

These scripts temporarily disable non-module pages during build, optimizing the build process and enabling module-specific deployments.

## Shared Resources

Resources shared across modules:

1. **UI Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/`
2. **Global Utilities**: Located in `src/lib/`
3. **Types**: Located in `src/types/`
4. **Global Styles**: Located in `src/app/globals.css`

## Best Practices

1. **Component Imports**:

   - Always use absolute imports (`@/components/...`)
   - Prefer destructured imports for UI components

2. **Module Boundaries**:

   - Keep module-specific code within its module
   - Avoid cross-module imports to maintain isolation
   - Extract common functionality to shared libraries

3. **API Structure**:

   - Module-specific APIs should be in `src/app/api/(module-name)/`
   - Shared APIs in `src/app/api/`

4. **Styling**:
   - Use Tailwind CSS for component styling
   - Module-specific styles in `src/app/(module-name)/styles/`
   - Global styles in `src/app/globals.css`

## Building and Deployment

### Building a Specific Module

```bash
# Build only the admin module
node scripts/build-admin.js
```

### Module-specific Deployment

Module-specific deployments reduce the risk of deployment failures by:

1. Limiting scope of changes
2. Reducing build times
3. Isolating deployment errors

## Monitoring and Metrics

To monitor the effectiveness of the modular architecture:

1. **Build Times**: Track build time improvements
2. **Deployment Success Rate**: Monitor deployment success/failure rate
3. **Component Resolution Times**: Track time to resolve components
4. **Bundle Sizes**: Monitor bundle size changes per module

## Future Improvements

1. **Additional Modules**: Implement modular structure for other sections
2. **Shared Component Library**: Extract shared components into a dedicated library
3. **Module-specific Testing**: Implement module-specific test suites
4. **API Contracts**: Define strict contracts for inter-module communication
5. **CI/CD Workflows**: Create module-specific CI/CD workflows
