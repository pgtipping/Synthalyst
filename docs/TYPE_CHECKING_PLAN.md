## TypeScript Type Checking Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment ✅

- Run `tsc --noEmit` to identify all type errors
- Categorize errors by type and severity
- Create a plan for addressing them

### Phase 2: Fix Critical Errors ✅

- Fix errors in core components and utilities
- Address errors that prevent the application from building
- Focus on API routes and data models

### Phase 3: Fix Non-Critical Errors ✅

- Address errors in less critical parts of the application
- Fix UI component prop type issues
- Handle library compatibility issues

### Phase 4: Implement Strict Type Checking (In Progress)

- Enable stricter TypeScript options
- Add explicit return types to functions
- Eliminate use of `any` type where possible

### Progress Update (2025-03-14)

- Initial error count: 43 errors in 21 files
- Previous error count: 17 errors in 13 files
- Current error count: 0 errors in 0 files
- Fixed issues:
  - Prisma schema mismatches (added missing fields)
  - Component prop type errors
  - API route parameter type issues
  - Missing module dependencies
  - Breadcrumb component className prop
  - ShareButtons component summary prop
  - AIAssistant component props
  - Newsletter analytics type issues
  - Rate limit Duration type
  - Job description generator type issues

### Recently Fixed Issues

1. Fixed component prop types by updating component definitions:

   - Added `className` prop to Breadcrumb component
   - Added `summary` prop as an alias for description in ShareButtons
   - Added missing props to AIAssistant component

2. Fixed API route type issues:

   - Added proper type handling in jd-developer/generate/route.ts
   - Fixed newsletter analytics type issues
   - Added @ts-expect-error comments with clear explanations where needed

3. Fixed library compatibility issues:
   - Added @ts-expect-error for Duration type in rate-limit.ts
   - Fixed PDF generation getNumberOfPages type issue

### Next Steps

1. Implement stricter TypeScript options in tsconfig.json
2. Add explicit return types to all functions
3. Eliminate use of `any` type where possible
4. Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to improve type inference
5. Consider implementing a pre-commit hook to run type checking
