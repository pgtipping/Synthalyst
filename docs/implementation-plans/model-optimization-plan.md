# Model Optimization and UI Enhancement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for optimizing our LLM model usage and enhancing the user interface for the Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator features. The goal is to improve cost efficiency while maintaining or enhancing output quality, and to create a more user-friendly multilingual experience.

## Current State

### Knowledge GPT

- Currently using GPT-4o model for all operations
- No language selection option for users
- Limited UI for interaction

### Learning Creator

- Currently using GPT-4o model for all operations
- No language selection option for users
- Basic form-based interface

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Model Optimization

#### Knowledge GPT: Switch to Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B

- **Rationale**: Lower cost (0.0375/input, 0.15/output for â‰¤128K tokens), good for summarization, multilingual support, and low latency
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Update API integration in `/api/knowledge-gpt/route.ts`
  2. Adjust system prompts to optimize for Gemini's capabilities
  3. Implement error handling specific to Gemini API

#### Learning Creator: Switch to GPT-4o-Mini

- **Rationale**: Balanced cost-to-capability ratio (0.15/input, 0.6/output), strong content generation, complex reasoning, and multilingual support
- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Update API integration in `/api/learning-content/route.ts`
  2. Adjust system prompts to optimize for GPT-4o-Mini's capabilities
  3. Implement error handling specific to OpenAI API

#### Tiered Approach Implementation

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create a router service in `/lib/ai/model-router.ts` that selects the appropriate model based on:
     - Task complexity
     - Content length
     - User preferences
     - Cost considerations
  2. Define complexity thresholds and routing rules
  3. Implement fallback mechanisms for API failures

### 2. Multilingual Support Enhancement

#### User Interface Updates

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Add language selection dropdown to both features
  2. Display supported languages with flags/icons
  3. Store user language preference in user settings
  4. Implement language detection from browser settings as default

#### System Prompt Enhancements

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Update system prompts to include language awareness
  2. Add instructions for responding in the user's selected language
  3. Optimize prompts for multilingual content generation

#### Supported Languages Display

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Create a component to display supported languages
  2. Implement a tooltip or info modal showing language capabilities
  3. Add language tags to generated content

### 3. UI Improvements

#### Knowledge GPT

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Redesign question input area with better guidance
  2. Add topic suggestions based on previous questions
  3. Implement a more visually appealing answer display
  4. Add options to save, share, or export answers
  5. Improve history view with better filtering and search

#### Learning Creator

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Redesign form with clearer sections and guidance
  2. Add templates for common content types
  3. Implement preview functionality
  4. Enhance content display with formatting options
  5. Add export options for different formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)

### 4. Testing and Validation

- **Implementation Steps**:
  1. Develop test cases for each model and language combination
  2. Implement A/B testing to compare model performance
  3. Collect user feedback on output quality
  4. Monitor cost metrics to validate optimization
  5. Adjust model selection thresholds based on performance data

## Timeline

1. **Phase 1 (Week 1)**: Model Integration

   - Implement Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B for Knowledge GPT
   - Implement GPT-4o-Mini for Learning Creator
   - Create basic model router

2. **Phase 2 (Week 2)**: Multilingual Support

   - Add language selection UI
   - Update system prompts
   - Implement language detection

3. **Phase 3 (Week 3)**: UI Enhancements

   - Redesign Knowledge GPT interface
   - Redesign Learning Creator interface
   - Implement new features

4. **Phase 4 (Week 4)**: Testing and Refinement
   - Conduct testing across languages and use cases
   - Gather user feedback
   - Make final adjustments

## Success Metrics

1. **Cost Efficiency**: 30-40% reduction in API costs
2. **User Satisfaction**: Positive feedback on multilingual support
3. **Output Quality**: Maintain or improve quality ratings
4. **Performance**: Maintain or improve response times

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to optimizing our LLM usage while enhancing the user experience. By implementing a tiered model approach and improving multilingual support, we can provide a more cost-effective and user-friendly experience for our users.
