### Interview Prep Feature Implementation - June 12, 2024

We have successfully implemented the Interview Preparation feature with the following components:

   - Updated the User model with new relations for the Interview Prep feature

2. **API Routes**:

   - Created the Mock Interview API routes:
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview` - For starting sessions and submitting responses
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview/[sessionId]` - For retrieving and ending sessions
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview/evaluate` - For evaluating interview responses
   - Created the Question Library API routes:
     - `/api/interview-prep/questions` - For browsing and saving questions
     - `/api/interview-prep/questions/[id]` - For managing individual saved questions

3. **UI Components**:
   - Created the main Interview Prep page as an entry point to all features
   - Implemented the Mock Interview feature:
     - Created the mock interview page with session management
     - Added a summary page to display session results
   - Implemented the Question Library feature:

     - Added a question detail page for editing notes

All components are designed with a mobile-first approach and follow the existing UI patterns of the application.
