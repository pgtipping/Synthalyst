# Active Context - March 17, 2025

## Current Focus

The current focus is on optimizing backend services, particularly in email handling, feedback processing, and admin monitoring capabilities. We're also working on enhancing the user experience with improved error handling and more robust API responses.

## Recent Changes

### Contact Form Error Fixes - March 17, 2025

- Fixed 500 Internal Server Error in the contact form submission process
- Implemented a more robust error handling approach with graceful degradation:
  - Separated database operations from email sending with independent try-catch blocks
  - Made each operation (database save, admin email, user email) independent
  - Added tracking for success/failure of each operation
  - Return success as long as at least one operation succeeds
  - Include detailed warnings in the response about any failed operations
- Enhanced the `hasEmailLogModel` function to properly check if the EmailLog model exists using try-catch
- Improved BigInt serialization for database IDs in JSON responses
- Added detailed error information capture from API responses
- Made email logging optional to prevent failures if the database is unavailable
- Verified fix works in production environment with real user submissions
- Successfully built and deployed the changes to production
- Confirmed all Prisma migrations are properly applied (28 migrations total)
- Tested the contact form with real user data to ensure it works correctly
- Added comprehensive documentation in memory-bank and .cursorrules about the error handling patterns

### Admin Dashboard Navigation Improvements - March 15, 2025

- Fixed the main Synthalyst app navbar overlapping with the admin sidebar
- Created a ConditionalHeader component to hide the main site header on admin pages
- Removed the scroll behavior from the admin navbar for better usability
- Simplified the admin navigation by removing the top navbar on desktop
- Kept only the sidebar for navigation on desktop for a cleaner interface
- Added a mobile-only top bar with menu toggle and logout button
- Ensured proper z-index values to prevent overlapping elements
- Updated the root layout to conditionally render the header based on the current path
- Improved the overall admin navigation experience with a more focused interface

## Next Steps

1. **Email Webhook Configuration**

   - Set up SendGrid Inbound Parse for email handling
   - Configure webhook endpoints to properly process incoming emails
   - Test the email processing workflow from external sources

2. **Database Migration Completion**

   - Complete the Prisma migration for the EmailLog model
   - Test the unified email service implementation

3. **Admin Dashboard Enhancements**

   - Add more detailed analytics for email logs
   - Implement a systematic approach to error detection and resolution across all admin pages
   - Create a contact form monitoring system to detect and resolve issues quickly

4. **Error Handling Standardization**
   - Apply the new error handling pattern with graceful degradation to other critical API routes
   - Implement BigInt serialization consistently across all API responses
   - Add comprehensive error logging and monitoring for all user-facing features

## Active Decisions

### Error Handling Strategy - March 17, 2025

- Use nested try-catch blocks to handle different types of errors separately
- Separate database errors from email sending errors and other API errors
- Make features optional when they depend on external services or database models
- Enhance error messages with detailed information for better debugging
- Implement graceful degradation so features can succeed even if some parts fail
- Add checks to verify if database models exist before attempting to use them
- Use TypeScript to ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors
- Serialize BigInt values to strings before including them in JSON responses

### Admin Navigation Design - March 15, 2025

- Hide the main site header on admin pages for a cleaner interface
- Use a sidebar-only navigation approach for desktop admin pages
- Implement a mobile-only top bar with essential controls for smaller screens
- Ensure consistent layout and navigation across all admin pages

### Email Service Architecture - March 14, 2025

- Use a unified email service with standardized approach for all email sending functionality
- Implement fallback mechanisms between SendGrid and Nodemailer for reliable email delivery
- Add email logging to track all email activities with the new EmailLog model
- Make email logging optional to prevent failures if the database is unavailable

## Technical Challenges

1. **BigInt Serialization**

   - BigInt values cannot be serialized to JSON directly
   - Need to implement a helper function to convert BigInt to strings before JSON serialization
   - Must be applied consistently across all API responses that might contain database IDs

2. **Database Model Existence**

   - Attempting to use a database model that doesn't exist yet can cause runtime errors
   - Need to check if models exist before attempting to use them
   - Must handle cases where migrations haven't been applied yet

3. **Error Handling in Distributed Operations**

   - Operations like contact form submission involve multiple steps (database, emails)
   - Need to handle failures in any step without failing the entire operation
   - Must provide meaningful error messages to users while preserving technical details for debugging

4. **Next.js 15 Compatibility**
   - Dynamic route parameters now require awaiting params object
   - Need to update API routes to properly handle this change
   - Must ensure consistent error handling across all routes
