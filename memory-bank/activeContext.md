### Interview Prep Plan Production Fixes

We've implemented several improvements to ensure the Interview Prep Plan generation works reliably in production:

1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the plan generation process to identify issues in production.

   - Client-side logging for API requests and responses
   - Server-side logging for API endpoint execution
   - Detailed error capturing and reporting

2. **Improved Fallback Mechanism**: Restructured the fallback plan generation to ensure users always receive a useful plan even if the AI service fails.

   - Properly structured fallback plan with consistent data format
   - Improved fallback questions generation
   - Better error handling and user feedback

3. **Environment Variable Verification**: Added checks to verify that the Gemini API key is properly configured in the production environment.

   - Explicit logging of API key availability (without exposing the key)
   - Clear error messages when configuration is missing

4. **API Response Handling**: Enhanced the parsing and processing of API responses to handle various edge cases.
   - Better JSON parsing with multiple fallback strategies
   - Validation of response structure before using it
   - Type safety improvements throughout the codebase

### UI Improvements

1. **Badge Updates**: Changed the ApplyRight tool badge from "Most Popular" to "New" to maintain consistency with other recently developed tools and create a more cohesive user experience.

2. **Newsletter Signup Component**: Updated the NewsletterSignup component to ensure the subscribe button has the same width as the input field for better visual consistency.
   - Separated the layout logic for minimal and default variants
   - Added explicit width classes to ensure proper alignment
   - Improved responsive behavior with a cleaner implementation

### Home Page Reorganization

We've updated the home page to better showcase our more developed tools:

1. **Featured Career Development Tools**: Added ApplyRight and Interview Prep as the primary featured tools in a new "Career Development Tools" category.

2. **De-emphasized JD Developer**: Moved JD Developer from the most prominent position to a secondary position in the "Content Generation" category and removed its "Most Popular" badge.

3. **Updated Value Proposition**: Changed the hero section to focus on a broader value proposition around career development rather than just job description generation.

4. **Revised AI Showcase**: Updated the AI showcase section to demonstrate resume optimization rather than job description generation.

5. **Reorganized Tool Categories**: Created a more logical organization of tools with Career Development, Content Generation, Intelligent Analysis, and Knowledge Processing categories.

### Audio Recording Functionality

We've implemented significant improvements to the audio recording functionality:

1. **Server-side Storage**: Audio files are now stored on the server rather than relying on client-side downloads, which were failing in localhost environments.

2. **API Routes**: Created `/api/audio` endpoints for uploading and downloading audio files.

3. **MediaRecorder Fixes**: Resolved issues with the MediaRecorder API, including:

   - Setting appropriate MIME types
   - Proper error handling
   - Improved blob handling

4. **Testing**: Added comprehensive tests for the AudioRecorder component and API routes.

5. **User Experience**: Improved the recording experience with:
   - Progress bar showing recording duration
   - Timer display
   - Clear status indicators
   - Better error messages

### Next Steps

1. Monitor production logs to verify Interview Prep Plan generation is working correctly
2. Implement audio playback improvements
3. Add audio file management (listing, deleting)
4. Integrate audio recording with other components
5. Add audio transcription functionality
