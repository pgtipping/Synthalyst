# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus (2024-03-01)

The current focus is on improving the JD Developer component's user experience and fixing template filtering issues. We've enhanced the template guide with better styling and clearer instructions about required fields. We've also fixed an issue where templates were appearing in both the templates list and the saved job descriptions list by improving the filtering logic in the API endpoints. Most recently, we've improved the loading state UI for the templates tab to provide a smoother and more consistent user experience.

Previous focus was on fixing deployment issues with Vercel and improving the JD Developer component by removing unnecessary validation requirements. We've successfully modified the API route to make education, experience, and certifications optional, fixing a console error that was preventing job description generation.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

Previous changes:

- Fixed Vercel deployment issues:

  - Wrapped `useSearchParams()` in a Suspense boundary in the signup page
  - Refactored the signup page to follow the same pattern as the signin page
  - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`

- Fixed JD Developer validation requirements:

  - Removed mandatory education requirements from the API validation schema
  - Removed mandatory experience requirements from the API validation schema
  - Removed mandatory certifications requirements from the API validation schema
  - Ensured proper data handling in the API route for optional fields
  - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/api/jd-developer/generate/route.ts`

- Added Google sign-in buttons to both sign-in and sign-up pages
- Implemented loading states and error handling for Google authentication
- Fixed duplicate NEXTAUTH_URL entries in the .env file
- Added clear comments in the .env file to distinguish between local and production URLs
- Ensured consistent UI design between traditional and Google authentication options

Previous changes:

- Updated the mock Prisma client to support JobDescription, Task, and User models
- Created comprehensive test files for JD Developer, 2Do, and Auth APIs
- Fixed Jest configuration to handle ESM modules and browser-specific APIs
- Updated test assertions to match the actual API response format

## Next Steps (2024-03-01)

1. Test the template filtering to ensure templates only appear in the templates list
2. Verify that saved job descriptions don't include templates
3. Consider adding sample templates for new users to get started quickly
4. Monitor the Vercel deployment to ensure all fixes are working properly
5. Test the JD Developer form to ensure it works without education, experience, and certifications
6. Consider adding loading states for salary generation in JD Developer
7. Complete test coverage for JD Developer
8. Test the Google authentication flow in the development environment

## Active Decisions (2024-03-01)

- Implemented a minimum loading time for the templates tab to ensure a smoother user experience
- Enhanced the loading UI to be more consistent with the Saved JDs tab
- Decided against including sample templates in the codebase, instead providing a comprehensive guide for users to create their own templates
- Using double-checking of parsed content to ensure proper filtering of templates vs. saved JDs
- Enhancing the template guide with clear instructions and better UI to improve user experience
- Making education, experience, and certifications optional in the JD Developer form
- Using Google OAuth as an additional authentication method alongside email/password
- Maintaining consistent UI patterns across authentication methods
- Ensuring clear environment configuration with proper comments
- Using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern for all API tests
- Ensuring consistent error handling across all API endpoints
- Maintaining the mock Prisma client to stay in sync with the actual Prisma schema

## Considerations (2024-03-01)

- Loading states should be consistent across the application for a better user experience
- Minimum loading times can improve perceived performance by preventing brief flashes of loading states
- The template guide should clearly indicate which fields are required vs. optional
- The filtering logic for templates vs. saved JDs should be robust and handle edge cases
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
- The LLM prompt for job description generation may need adjustments to handle missing fields
- The Google OAuth configuration needs to be properly set up in the Google Cloud Console
- Authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs need to be configured correctly
- Environment variables need to be set correctly for both development and production
- The mock Prisma client should be kept in sync with the actual Prisma schema
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
