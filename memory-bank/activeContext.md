# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus (2023-07-10)

The current focus is on improving the test coverage for the API endpoints, particularly:

- JD Developer API (save and delete endpoints)
- 2Do Tasks API (CRUD operations)
- Auth API (signup endpoint)

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

## Recent Changes

- Updated the mock Prisma client to support JobDescription, Task, and User models
- Created comprehensive test files for JD Developer, 2Do, and Auth APIs
- Fixed Jest configuration to handle ESM modules and browser-specific APIs
- Updated test assertions to match the actual API response format

## Next Steps

1. Run the full test suite to ensure all tests pass
2. Add tests for any remaining API endpoints
3. Enhance the mock Prisma client as needed for additional models
4. Update documentation to reflect the standardized testing approach

## Active Decisions

- Using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern for all API tests
- Ensuring consistent error handling across all API endpoints
- Maintaining the mock Prisma client to stay in sync with the actual Prisma schema

## Considerations

- The mock Prisma client should be kept in sync with the actual Prisma schema
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
