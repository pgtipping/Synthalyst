# Active Context (Updated: March 19, 2025)

## Current Focus

The team is working on two major challenges in the Synthalyst application:

1. **Persistent UI Styling Issues**:

   - Critical CSS and Tailwind CSS integration problems in both development and production
   - UI components appearing as unstyled HTML despite critical CSS loading
   - Issues with CSS cascade and loading order

2. **Severe Deployment Problems**:
   - 97% failure rate for Vercel deployments
   - Component resolution failures in production builds
   - Path alias resolution issues with `@/components/ui/` imports

### Modular Architecture Implementation (March 19, 2025)

We've successfully implemented the first phase of our modular architecture plan:

1. **Admin Module Migration**:

   - Created route group structure for admin module using `(admin)` route group
   - Migrated admin components to the module-specific directory structure
   - Implemented module-specific utilities and helpers
   - Developed custom build script for isolated admin module building
   - Fixed route conflicts between admin and public sections

2. **Documentation Creation**:

   - Created extensive documentation on the modular architecture approach
   - Documented component organization guidelines
   - Created detailed documentation for the admin build script
   - Added README for the documentation directory

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Successfully built the admin module in isolation
   - Resolved component resolution issues
   - Fixed CSS import conflicts

### Modular Architecture Transition Plan (March 19, 2025)

The overall plan for transitioning to a modular architecture includes:

1. **Next.js Route Groups Approach**:

   - Restructure the application into logical modules using Next.js route groups
   - Create independent modules for admin, public site, knowledge tools, applications, blog
   - Implement module-specific styling and build processes

2. **CSS Strategy Overhaul**:

   - Module-specific CSS/Tailwind configurations with isolation
   - Standardized design tokens shared across modules
   - Elimination of complex CSS loading strategies
   - Consider downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3 for stability

3. **Component Resolution Fix**:

   - Move from path aliases to relative imports for critical components
   - Create module-specific component libraries
   - Implement versioned shared components with strict interfaces

4. **Build Process Improvements**:
   - Module-specific build scripts and configurations
   - Independent deployment targets for each module
   - Comprehensive testing for module boundaries

## Recent Changes

### Admin Module Implementation (March 19, 2025)

1. **Directory Structure**:

   - Created `src/app/(admin)/` route group
   - Migrated admin components to `src/app/(admin)/components/`
   - Added module-specific utilities in `src/app/(admin)/lib/`
   - Added module-specific styles in `src/app/(admin)/styles/`

2. **Build Process**:

   - Created `scripts/build-admin.js` for isolated admin module building
   - Implemented temporary file structure manipulation for focused builds
   - Added configuration management for admin-specific builds
   - Resolved route conflicts between admin and public routes

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/` directory for technical documentation
   - Added comprehensive documentation on the modular architecture
   - Added detailed component organization guidelines
   - Documented the admin build script process and usage

### CSS Optimization Work (March 18, 2025)

1. Fixed duplicate PostCSS configuration files by removing the root-level file
2. Identified conflicts between critical.css and globals.css
3. Restructured CSS architecture to properly handle CSS variables and Tailwind CSS integration
4. Added CSS diagnostic tools for better debugging

Despite these changes, UI styling remains inconsistent, especially in the development environment, indicating a more fundamental architecture issue.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Next Actions**:

   - Migrate additional routes and components to the admin module
   - Implement automated testing for the admin module
   - Deploy admin module to staging environment to validate the approach
   - Monitor build performance and component resolution metrics

2. **Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-3)**:

   - Develop shared component library with explicit interfaces
   - Migrate additional modules (blog, knowledge tools) to route group structure
   - Implement API contracts between modules
   - Create CI/CD workflows for modular testing

3. **Medium-term Vision**:
   - Complete module migration for all application sections
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring
   - Refine developer experience for modular workflow

## Development Environment

This project is configured to run on localhost:3001. Always check server status before starting and terminate running server before invoking the build command.

For module-specific development:

- Admin module: `node scripts/build-admin.js`

## Active Decisions

- **Architecture Implementation**: Successfully moved admin module to modular architecture using Next.js route groups
- **CSS Approach**: Module-specific CSS with shared design tokens
- **Deployment Strategy**: Independent module builds and deployments, starting with admin module
- **Next Module Focus**: Blog and knowledge tools modules
- **Mobile-first Approach**: All UI development must maintain mobile responsiveness

## Considerations

- **Migration Timeline**: Continue balancing between comprehensive solution and immediate deployment needs
- **Team Organization**: Consider reorganizing team structure around modules
- **Learning Curve**: Document workflows for the team to adapt to modular development
- **Performance Impact**: Initial admin module build shows promise in build time improvements
- **User Experience**: Maintain consistent UX during incremental migration
