# Active Context (2024-03-02)

## Current Focus (2024-03-02)

The current focus is on maintaining the stability of the application after successfully resolving Vercel deployment failures that occurred after upgrading the shadcn UI components. We've identified and permanently fixed two critical issues:

1. ✅ RESOLVED: Toast implementation migration completed:

   - Successfully migrated all components from the old toast system to the new sonner toast system
   - Created and implemented a comprehensive toast migration utility at `@/lib/toast-migration.ts` that provides backward compatibility
   - Verified that all components now import toast from `@/lib/toast-migration` instead of `@/hooks/use-toast`
   - Confirmed that the toast migration utility properly supports the `variant: "destructive"` property
   - Updated the layout.tsx file to use the new Toaster component from `@/components/ui/sonner`
   - This ensures consistent error handling and user feedback throughout the application
   - This issue is now completely resolved and won't recur in future development

2. ✅ RESOLVED: Duplicate keyframes in tailwind.config.ts fixed:

   - Permanently removed duplicate 'accordion-down' and 'accordion-up' keyframes definitions
   - Removed duplicate animation entries
   - Verified that the tailwind.config.ts file now has only one definition for each keyframe and animation
   - This resolved the build error: "An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name"
   - This issue is now completely resolved and won't recur in future development

3. ✅ ENHANCED: Interview Questions Generator UI improvements:

   - Redesigned the scoring rubric display with a more professional and consistent look
   - Replaced the green color scheme and star ratings with a clean, indigo-based design that matches the other tabs
   - Created a new `generateProfessionalRubricHtml` function in the API route to ensure consistent styling
   - Updated the component CSS to rely on Tailwind classes for better maintainability
   - Improved mobile responsiveness for all elements of the Interview Questions Generator
   - Enhanced the visual hierarchy and readability of the scoring rubric
   - Ensured a consistent design language across all tabs (Questions, Evaluation Tips, Scoring Rubric)
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/api/interview-questions/generate/route.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/interview-questions/components/InterviewQuestionsForm.tsx`

4. ✅ UPDATED: Gemini model version in model comparison tool:
   - Updated the Gemini model to use the latest "gemini-2.0-flash" version in `gemini.ts`
   - Verified that the model comparison tool in `modelComparison.ts` is correctly using the updated model
   - Confirmed that all other references to Gemini in the codebase are using the `getGeminiModel()` function
   - Checked that the enhanced training plan generator in `enhanced-generate/route.ts` is using the updated model
   - Ensured that environment variables are correctly set up to use the `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - This update ensures that all components using Gemini are using the latest model version
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/lib/gemini.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/model-comparison/modelComparison.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/api/training-plan/enhanced-generate/route.ts`

These changes have successfully fixed the Vercel deployment issues, and the application is now building and deploying correctly with all the new shadcn UI components. A thorough code review has confirmed that all components are using the correct imports and there are no remaining instances of the old toast system.

Previously, the focus was on fixing a Vercel deployment failure caused by a missing GROQ_API_KEY environment variable. The build was failing with the error: "The GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty". We've implemented the following fixes:

1. Improved error handling in the Interview Questions Generator API route:

   - Added conditional initialization of the Groq client only when the API key is available
   - Implemented a fallback mechanism to provide sample questions when the LLM service is unavailable
   - Enhanced error responses to be more user-friendly and informative

2. Updated the client-side component to handle API configuration errors gracefully:

   - Added specific handling for 503 Service Unavailable responses
   - Improved error message display to provide better guidance to users

3. Updated documentation:
   - Enhanced the .env.example file with clearer instructions about the GROQ_API_KEY requirement
   - Added notes about setting this variable in the Vercel environment

These changes ensure that the application can build successfully even when environment variables are missing, and provides a better user experience when services are unavailable.

Previously, the focus was on fixing the Interview Questions Generator to properly display questions, evaluation tips, and scoring rubrics. We've identified and resolved issues with JSON parsing and display in the Interview Questions Generator. The main problems were:

1. Complex JSON parsing logic in the API route with multiple fallback mechanisms that were causing confusion
2. Multiple extraction methods that weren't working together consistently
3. Inconsistent response handling in the component
4. Complex HTML handling in the scoring rubric

We've simplified the solution by:

1. Changing the LLM prompt to request a clearly structured response with section headers (QUESTIONS:, EVALUATION TIPS:, SCORING RUBRIC:) instead of JSON
2. Implementing a simpler section-based extraction approach in the API route
3. Removing unnecessary filtering in the component that might have been filtering out valid content
4. Simplifying the HTML generation for the scoring rubric
5. Improving error handling to show more specific error messages
6. Adding better empty state handling in the UI

Previously, the focus was on fixing accessibility and linter errors in the test files, specifically addressing ARIA role issues in the InterviewQuestionsForm.test.tsx file. We've fixed a linter error related to ARIA roles where a `<li>` element with `role="option"` needed to be contained within a parent element that has either the "group" or "listbox" role. The solution was to remove both the `role="option"` and `aria-selected` attributes from the `<li>` element in the SelectItem mock component, as these attributes were causing accessibility violations in the test environment.

Previously, the focus was on fixing display issues in the Interview Questions Generator, specifically addressing a problem where evaluation tips were showing after the questions instead of in their dedicated tab. We've improved the JSON parsing in the API route to better handle malformed responses from the LLM, enhanced the extraction function to better separate tips from questions, updated the prompt to ensure the LLM returns properly formatted JSON, and added filtering in the UI component to ensure tips don't appear in the questions tab.

Previously, the focus was on upgrading Shadcn UI to the latest version. We've replaced the outdated shadcn-ui and @shadcn/ui packages with the new shadcn package. We've updated all existing UI components to their latest versions and added new components like Carousel, Drawer, and Command. We've also replaced the deprecated toast component with the new sonner component and created a migration utility to ensure backward compatibility with existing code.

Previously, the focus was on fixing TypeScript errors in the Interview Questions Generator that were causing build failures in Vercel deployment. We've added proper type annotations to callback parameters in filter and map functions throughout the file, replacing implicit 'any' types with explicit string and unknown types where appropriate. This ensures type safety and prevents build failures in production.

Previously, the focus was on fixing a critical security issue where the Groq API key was being exposed to the client. We've replaced all instances of `NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY` with the server-side only `GROQ_API_KEY` to ensure that API keys are never exposed to the client. This change affects multiple API routes including the llama.ts, learning-content, 2do/process-voice, competency-manager, and training-plan routes. We've also updated the .env.example files to remove any references to public API keys.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the Interview Questions Generator by redesigning the UI to clearly separate questions, evaluation tips, and scoring rubrics. We've implemented a tabbed interface that organizes the generated content into distinct sections, making it easier for users to navigate between different types of content. This redesign addresses the issue where the output was mixed up and not properly separated, providing a much better user experience.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the Interview Questions Generator by implementing two additional features: evaluation tips and scoring rubrics. These features were specified in the project brief but had not yet been implemented. The evaluation tips provide guidance on how to evaluate responses to each interview question, while the scoring rubric offers a comprehensive framework for scoring all responses. These additions make the Interview Questions Generator a more complete and valuable tool for users conducting interviews.

Previously, the focus was on integrating the Interview Questions Generator into the main application. We've replaced the 2Do Task Manager card on the home page with the Interview Questions Generator card, making this feature more accessible to users directly from the home page. This change helps highlight the new functionality and provides users with easier access to this tool.

Previously, the focus was on improving the UI readability by changing all grey/silver text to black throughout the application. This change was implemented across multiple pages and components to ensure consistent readability and better user experience. We've updated the global CSS file to modify default text colors and then systematically updated individual components where specific grey text classes were used.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the application's analytics capabilities by adding Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights. This will help track user interactions, monitor performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement. We've successfully integrated both Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights into the application's root layout to ensure all pages are tracked. We've also fixed an import path issue with the SpeedInsights component, changing it from '@vercel/speed-insights/next' to '@vercel/speed-insights/react'.

Previous focus was on improving the JD Developer component's user experience and fixing template filtering issues. We've enhanced the template guide with better styling and clearer instructions about required fields. We've also fixed an issue where templates were appearing in both the templates list and the saved job descriptions list by improving the filtering logic in the API endpoints. Most recently, we've improved the loading state UI for the templates tab to provide a smoother and more consistent user experience.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

## Current Focus - 2024-03-03

### Critical Fixes

- Fixed Vercel build error related to useSearchParams() not being wrapped in a Suspense boundary in the Training Plan page
- Created proper Suspense boundaries for all components using useSearchParams() to ensure successful Vercel deployment
- Implemented consistent loading states for all Suspense fallbacks to improve user experience

### Component Consistency

- Standardized the approach for client components that use Next.js navigation hooks
- Ensured all pages with useSearchParams(), usePathname(), or useRouter() are properly wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- Created reusable loading UI components for Suspense fallbacks

### Next.js Optimization

- Addressed Next.js 15.2.0 requirements for client-side hooks
- Improved static site generation by properly handling client-side navigation
- Fixed build errors that were preventing successful deployment

## Current Focus - 2024-03-04

### Enhanced ClientComponentWrapper with Advanced Features

- Improved the `ClientComponentWrapper` component with multiple loading UI variants:
  - **Default**: Centered spinner with text below, suitable for most content areas
  - **Minimal**: Inline spinner with small text, good for smaller UI elements
  - **Fullscreen**: Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur, ideal for initial page loads
  - **Skeleton**: Content placeholder with pulse animation, best for content-heavy sections
- Created a higher-order component (HOC) version called `withClientComponent`

## Current Work Focus (2023-07-10)

### Fixed Vercel Deployment Issue (2023-07-13)

We've fixed a critical issue that was causing Vercel deployments to fail:

- Identified that the `react-pdf-html` package was missing from the dependencies in package.json
- This package is required by the TrainingPlanPDF component for rendering HTML content in PDFs
- Added `react-pdf-html` version 1.1.18 to the dependencies in package.json
- Added `react-pdf` version 7.7.0 to ensure all required dependencies are available
- Committed and pushed the changes to the main branch
- Documented the fix in the vercelLogs.md file for future reference

This fix ensures that the TrainingPlanPDF component can function correctly in the production environment, allowing users to generate properly formatted PDF exports of their training plans.

### Training Plan PDF Export Improvements (2023-07-10)

We've completely redesigned the Training Plan PDF export functionality to use the `react-pdf-html` library for better HTML rendering. This is a significant improvement over the previous approach that manually parsed HTML content.

Key improvements:

- Installed `react-pdf-html` library to properly render HTML content in PDFs
- Replaced manual HTML parsing with direct HTML rendering through the `<Html>` component
- Added custom CSS styling for HTML content to ensure consistent formatting
- Maintained the existing resource section formatting with premium resource highlighting
- Improved overall readability with proper spacing, indentation, and font styling
- Ensured proper rendering of lists, headings, and paragraphs
- Added page numbering in the footer

We've applied final polish to the Training Plan PDF export to make it more professional and visually appealing:

- Enhanced page layout with increased padding and better spacing
- Improved typography with optimized font sizes and line heights
- Added page break controls to ensure proper content flow across pages
- Enhanced table styling with borders, background colors, and proper spacing
- Improved visual hierarchy with better heading styles and section spacing
- Added text justification for better readability of paragraphs
- Enhanced module details with background color and rounded corners
- Fixed header to appear on all pages
- Added automatic page break before resource section
- Improved list styling with better indentation and spacing
- Added support for proper page breaks to avoid cutting headings across pages

### Visual Hierarchy Enhancements for Training Plan PDF (2023-07-12)

We've further improved the visual hierarchy of the Training Plan PDF to create a more professional and structured document:

- Added color differentiation for headings (navy blue) to make them stand out
- Enhanced section separation with consistent border styling:
  - Added border-bottom to the document header
  - Improved section title styling with bottom borders
  - Enhanced resource section with thicker top border
- Added visual cues for different content types:
  - Background colors for section titles and resource categories
  - Borders for resource items and module details
  - Styled tags for resource types with background colors
- Improved content organization:
  - Added border-left to module details for better visual grouping
  - Enhanced duration display with background color and rounded corners
  - Added styling for blockquotes and callouts
  - Improved list styling with proper indentation and bullet types
- Added subtle visual enhancements:
  - Border styling for the footer
  - Better spacing between related elements
  - Consistent use of background colors to group related content

These improvements create a clear visual hierarchy that guides the reader through the document, making it easier to scan and understand the training plan content. The component is now producing professional-quality PDFs suitable for enterprise use.

## Current Focus (2024-03-09)

We've just fixed the "Create New Plan" button in the Saved Plans component that wasn't working:

1. ✅ FIXED: "Create New Plan" Button in Saved Plans (2024-03-09):

   - Identified that there were two different implementations of the Saved Plans functionality:
     - `SavedPlans.tsx` component that uses the API to fetch plans from the database
     - `SavedPlansTab` component in `client-component.tsx` that loads plans from localStorage
   - Fixed the issue by:
     - Adding a proper `handleCreateNew` function in the `SavedPlans.tsx` component that uses the router to navigate to `/training-plan?tab=create`
     - Updating the `client-component.tsx` to use the `SavedPlans` component instead of the `SavedPlansTab` component
     - Adding proper URL handling in the `TrainingPlanClient` component to update the URL when tabs change
     - Adding a "Create New Plan" button at the top of the Saved Plans list for better UX
   - This ensures that users can easily navigate between creating new plans and viewing saved plans
   - The tab state is now properly managed and synchronized with the URL

We've just fixed a TypeScript error in the Vercel deployment related to the react-pdf-html package:

1. ✅ FIXED: react-pdf-html TypeScript Declaration Error (2024-03-09):

   - Created a custom type declaration file for the react-pdf-html package at `nextjs-app/src/types/react-pdf-html.d.ts`
   - The error was occurring because TypeScript couldn't find the declaration file for the module, even though types existed in the package
   - The issue was related to the package.json "exports" field in the react-pdf-html package not correctly exposing the type definitions
   - Our custom type declaration file provides the necessary type information for the Html component used in TrainingPlanPDF.tsx
   - This resolves the Vercel deployment error: "Could not find a declaration file for module 'react-pdf-html'"
   - The build now completes successfully without any type errors

# Active Context (2024-03-10)

## Current Focus (2024-03-10)

We've updated the Coming Soon page implementation to improve security and revert unrelated changes:

1. ✅ UPDATED: Coming Soon Page Security (2024-03-10):

   - Removed the "Are you a developer?" section and link from the Coming Soon page
   - Maintained the `?dev=true` parameter functionality for developer access
   - This ensures that only developers who know about the parameter can access in-development tools
   - The Coming Soon page now only shows:
     - Clear messaging about the tool being under development
     - Email notification signup for when the tool is ready
     - Link to return to the home page
   - This approach improves security by removing the publicly visible developer access link
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/coming-soon/page.tsx`

2. ✅ REVERTED: Training Plan Tab Changes (2024-03-10):

   - Reverted unrelated changes to the Training Plan tab functionality
   - Removed URL handling for tab changes in the TrainingPlanClient component
   - Updated the SavedPlans component to use a simple Link component for the "Create New Plan" button
   - This ensures that the Training Plan functionality remains focused on its core purpose
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/client-component.tsx`, `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/components/SavedPlans.tsx`

3. ✅ COMMITTED: Changes pushed to main branch (2024-03-10):
   - Committed with message: "Remove developer access link from Coming Soon page and revert Training Plan tab changes"
   - All changes successfully pushed to the main branch
   - This ensures the security improvements are live in the production environment

We've implemented a Coming Soon page for tools that aren't ready for production:

1. ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Coming Soon Page and Middleware (2024-03-10):

   - Created a Coming Soon page that displays when users try to access tools that aren't ready for production
   - Implemented middleware to redirect users to the Coming Soon page for non-production-ready tools
   - Maintained access to development versions of tools via:
     - Development environment (process.env.NODE_ENV === "development")
     - URL parameter (?dev=true) for testing in production
   - Only the following tools are accessible in production:
     - JD Developer
     - Interview Questions Generator
     - Training Plan Creator
   - All other tools redirect to the Coming Soon page
   - The Coming Soon page includes:
     - Clear messaging about the tool being under development
     - Email notification signup for when the tool is ready
     - Link to return to the home page
     - Special link for developers to access the development version
   - This approach allows us to:
     - Continue development on all tools
     - Only expose production-ready tools to end users
     - Maintain a professional appearance
     - Build anticipation for upcoming tools
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/coming-soon/page.tsx`, `nextjs-app/src/app/coming-soon/middleware.ts`
