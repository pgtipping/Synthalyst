# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus (2024-03-01)

The current focus is on fixing deployment issues with Vercel. We've identified and resolved an issue with the signup page where `useSearchParams()` was not wrapped in a Suspense boundary, causing deployment failures. This is a requirement in Next.js 15.1.7 for client-side hooks.

Previous focus was on improving the JD Developer component by removing unnecessary validation requirements. We've successfully modified the API route to make education, experience, and certifications optional, fixing a console error that was preventing job description generation.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

## Recent Changes (2024-03-01)

- Fixed Vercel deployment issues:

  - Wrapped `useSearchParams()` in a Suspense boundary in the signup page
  - Refactored the signup page to follow the same pattern as the signin page
  - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/auth/signup/page.tsx`

- Fixed JD Developer validation requirements:

  - Removed mandatory education requirements from the API validation schema
  - Removed mandatory experience requirements from the API validation schema
  - Removed mandatory certifications requirements from the API validation schema
  - Ensured proper data handling in the API route for optional fields
  - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/api/jd-developer/generate/route.ts`

- Added Google sign-in buttons to both sign-in and sign-up pages
- Implemented loading states and error handling for Google authentication
- Fixed duplicate NEXTAUTH_URL entries in the .env file
- Added clear comments in the .env file to distinguish between local and production URLs
- Ensured consistent UI design between traditional and Google authentication options

Previous changes:

- Updated the mock Prisma client to support JobDescription, Task, and User models
- Created comprehensive test files for JD Developer, 2Do, and Auth APIs
- Fixed Jest configuration to handle ESM modules and browser-specific APIs
- Updated test assertions to match the actual API response format

## Next Steps (2024-03-01)

1. Monitor the Vercel deployment to ensure the fix resolves the issue
2. Check for similar issues in other pages that might use client-side hooks without Suspense boundaries
3. Test the JD Developer form to ensure it works without education, experience, and certifications
4. Consider adding loading states for salary generation in JD Developer
5. Complete test coverage for JD Developer
6. Test the Google authentication flow in the development environment
7. Configure Google OAuth for production environment

Previous next steps:

1. Run the full test suite to ensure all tests pass
2. Add tests for any remaining API endpoints
3. Enhance the mock Prisma client as needed for additional models
4. Update documentation to reflect the standardized testing approach

## Active Decisions (2024-03-01)

- Using Suspense boundaries for client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()` to comply with Next.js 15.1.7 requirements
- Making education, experience, and certifications optional in the JD Developer form
- Using Google OAuth as an additional authentication method alongside email/password
- Maintaining consistent UI patterns across authentication methods
- Ensuring clear environment configuration with proper comments
- Using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern for all API tests
- Ensuring consistent error handling across all API endpoints
- Maintaining the mock Prisma client to stay in sync with the actual Prisma schema

## Considerations (2024-03-01)

- Next.js 15.1.7 requires client-side hooks like `useSearchParams()` to be wrapped in Suspense boundaries
- We should review all pages using client-side hooks to ensure they follow this pattern
- The JD Developer form should clearly indicate which fields are required vs. optional
- The LLM prompt for job description generation may need adjustments to handle missing fields
- The Google OAuth configuration needs to be properly set up in the Google Cloud Console
- Authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs need to be configured correctly
- Environment variables need to be set correctly for both development and production
- The mock Prisma client should be kept in sync with the actual Prisma schema
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
