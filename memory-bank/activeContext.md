# Active Context (Updated: March 19, 2025)

## Current Focus - 2025-03-19

We're currently focused on implementing a modular architecture for the Synthalyst application. The main goals are:

1. **Admin Module Implementation**: We've successfully moved admin components to the `/app/(admin)` directory and created specific utilities and pages for admin functionality.

2. **CSS Loading Solution**: We've addressed critical CSS loading issues in the admin module by:

   - Creating dedicated CSS files for admin components
   - Moving away from styled-jsx in server components
   - Implementing a modular CSS approach with clear organization
   - Using standard CSS imports and variables for consistent styling
   - Recreated the non-critical.css file from backup to ensure proper loading of non-critical styles

   Documentation has been added at `nextjs-app/docs/admin-styling-solution.md`.

3. **Build Pipeline Optimization**: Updated build scripts to optimize for the modular architecture, focusing on:
   - Route-specific optimization
   - CSS processing improvements
   - Bundle size reduction

## Ongoing Challenges

1. **Toast Provider Issue**: The build is failing due to a `useToast` hook error in the interview-prep section. This needs to be investigated as a separate issue.

2. **Component Resolution**: We're still monitoring component resolution to ensure the modular architecture doesn't introduce new issues.

3. **UI Styling**: While we've improved the CSS approach for the admin module, we need to apply similar patterns to other modules.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the `useToast` provider issue in the interview-prep section
2. Continue migrating components to the modular architecture
3. Apply the CSS organization pattern to other modules
4. Implement shared component library for cross-module usage
5. Create API contracts between modules

### Modular Architecture Implementation (March 19, 2025)

We've successfully implemented the first phase of our modular architecture plan:

1. **Admin Module Migration**:

   - Created route group structure for admin module using `(admin)` route group
   - Migrated admin components to the module-specific directory structure
   - Implemented module-specific utilities and helpers
   - Developed custom build script for isolated admin module building
   - Fixed route conflicts between admin and public sections

2. **Documentation Creation**:

   - Created extensive documentation on the modular architecture approach
   - Documented component organization guidelines
   - Created detailed documentation for the admin build script
   - Added README for the documentation directory

3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Successfully built the admin module in isolation
   - Resolved component resolution issues
   - Fixed CSS import conflicts

### Modular Architecture Transition Plan (March 19, 2025)

The overall plan for transitioning to a modular architecture includes:

1. **Next.js Route Groups Approach**:

   - Restructure the application into logical modules using Next.js route groups
   - Create independent modules for admin, public site, knowledge tools, applications, blog
   - Implement module-specific styling and build processes

2. **CSS Strategy Overhaul**:

   - Module-specific CSS/Tailwind configurations with isolation
   - Standardized design tokens shared across modules
   - Elimination of complex CSS loading strategies
   - Consider downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3 for stability

3. **Component Resolution Fix**:

   - Move from path aliases to relative imports for critical components
   - Create module-specific component libraries
   - Implement versioned shared components with strict interfaces

4. **Build Process Improvements**:
   - Module-specific build scripts and configurations
   - Independent deployment targets for each module
   - Comprehensive testing for module boundaries

## Recent Changes

### Admin Module Implementation (March 19, 2025)

1. **Directory Structure**:

   - Created `src/app/(admin)/` route group
   - Migrated admin components to `src/app/(admin)/components/`
   - Added module-specific utilities in `src/app/(admin)/lib/`
   - Added module-specific styles in `src/app/(admin)/styles/`

2. **Build Process**:

   - Created `scripts/build-admin.js` for isolated admin module building
   - Implemented temporary file structure manipulation for focused builds
   - Added configuration management for admin-specific builds
   - Resolved route conflicts between admin and public routes

3. **Documentation**:
   - Created `docs/` directory for technical documentation
   - Added comprehensive documentation on the modular architecture
   - Added detailed component organization guidelines
   - Documented the admin build script process and usage

### CSS Optimization Work (March 18, 2025)

1. Fixed duplicate PostCSS configuration files by removing the root-level file
2. Identified conflicts between critical.css and globals.css
3. Restructured CSS architecture to properly handle CSS variables and Tailwind CSS integration
4. Added CSS diagnostic tools for better debugging

Despite these changes, UI styling remains inconsistent, especially in the development environment, indicating a more fundamental architecture issue.

## Development Environment

This project is configured to run on localhost:3001. Always check server status before starting and terminate running server before invoking the build command.

For module-specific development:

- Admin module: `node scripts/build-admin.js`

## Active Decisions

- **Architecture Implementation**: Successfully moved admin module to modular architecture using Next.js route groups
- **CSS Approach**: Module-specific CSS with shared design tokens
- **Deployment Strategy**: Independent module builds and deployments, starting with admin module
- **Next Module Focus**: Blog and knowledge tools modules
- **Mobile-first Approach**: All UI development must maintain mobile responsiveness

## Considerations

- **Migration Timeline**: Continue balancing between comprehensive solution and immediate deployment needs
- **Team Organization**: Consider reorganizing team structure around modules
- **Learning Curve**: Document workflows for the team to adapt to modular development
- **Performance Impact**: Initial admin module build shows promise in build time improvements
- **User Experience**: Maintain consistent UX during incremental migration
