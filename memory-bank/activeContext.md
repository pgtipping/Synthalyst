## LLM Quality Control Improvements (2025-03-10)

We've implemented several enhancements to improve the quality and consistency of LLM-generated content:

1. ✅ ENHANCED: Interview Questions Rubric Generation (2025-03-10):
   - Improved system prompt with specific instructions for rubric criteria
   - Added requirements for detailed, well-formed criteria that clearly distinguish performance levels
   - Lowered temperature parameter from 0.7 to 0.5 for more consistent outputs
   - Implemented comprehensive quality validation for criteria, checking for:
     - Minimum length (15 characters)
     - Proper sentence structure (not single words)
     - Minimum word count (5 words)
     - Complete sentences with proper punctuation
     - Presence of key assessment terms (skills, competencies, knowledge, etc.)
   - Created more detailed, industry-specific fallback criteria for when LLM generation fails quality checks
   - This ensures consistently high-quality rubrics that provide meaningful evaluation guidance

   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/coming-soon/page.tsx`, `nextjs-app/src/app/coming-soon/middleware.ts`

## Strategic Authentication Implementation (2024-03-05)

We've implemented a more user-friendly authentication approach that allows users to experience the app's functionality before requiring them to sign in. This strategic authentication is triggered at specific action points rather than blocking entire routes:

1. **Authentication Triggers:**

   - After 3 uses of the Interview Questions Generator
   - When saving job descriptions or templates in JD Developer
   - When saving training plans
   - When accessing saved content (e.g., saved training plans)

2. **Implementation Details:**

   - Removed route-based authentication from middleware
   - Added client-side usage counters stored in localStorage
   - Implemented authentication checks at specific action points
   - Added user-friendly authentication prompts with direct sign-in buttons

3. **Benefits:**

   - Improved user experience by allowing exploration before authentication
   - Increased potential for user conversion by demonstrating value first
   - Maintained security for sensitive operations and data
   - Better alignment with modern web application authentication patterns

4. **Files Modified:**

   - `nextjs-app/src/middleware.ts`
   - `nextjs-app/src/app/interview-questions/components/InterviewQuestionsForm.tsx`
   - `nextjs-app/src/app/jd-developer/components/JDForm.tsx`
   - `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/components/TrainingPlanClient.tsx`
   - `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/components/PlanForm.tsx`

5. **Follow-up Fixes (2025-03-05):**
   - Fixed a build error in Vercel deployment caused by missing props in client-component.tsx
   - Updated the PlanForm component in client-component.tsx to include the required props
   - Fixed another build error in Vercel deployment caused by missing props in client.tsx
   - Updated the PlanForm component in client.tsx to include the required props
   - Verified both fixes by running successful builds locally
   - Files modified:
     - `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/client-component.tsx`
     - `nextjs-app/src/app/training-plan/client.tsx`
