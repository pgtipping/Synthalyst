# Active Context (Updated: March 19, 2025)

## Current Focus

The team is working on two major challenges in the Synthalyst application:

1. **Persistent UI Styling Issues**:

   - Critical CSS and Tailwind CSS integration problems in both development and production
   - UI components appearing as unstyled HTML despite critical CSS loading
   - Issues with CSS cascade and loading order

2. **Severe Deployment Problems**:
   - 97% failure rate for Vercel deployments
   - Component resolution failures in production builds
   - Path alias resolution issues with `@/components/ui/` imports

### Modular Architecture Transition (March 19, 2025)

After evaluating multiple approaches to resolve these persistent issues, we've decided to implement a comprehensive modular architecture plan:

1. **Next.js Route Groups Approach**:

   - Restructure the application into logical modules using Next.js route groups
   - Create independent modules for admin, public site, knowledge tools, applications, blog
   - Implement module-specific styling and build processes

2. **CSS Strategy Overhaul**:

   - Module-specific CSS/Tailwind configurations with isolation
   - Standardized design tokens shared across modules
   - Elimination of complex CSS loading strategies
   - Consider downgrading to Tailwind CSS v3 for stability

3. **Component Resolution Fix**:

   - Move from path aliases to relative imports for critical components
   - Create module-specific component libraries
   - Implement versioned shared components with strict interfaces

4. **Build Process Improvements**:
   - Module-specific build scripts and configurations
   - Independent deployment targets for each module
   - Comprehensive testing for module boundaries

## Recent Changes

### CSS Optimization Work (March 18, 2025)

1. Fixed duplicate PostCSS configuration files by removing the root-level file
2. Identified conflicts between critical.css and globals.css
3. Restructured CSS architecture to properly handle CSS variables and Tailwind CSS integration
4. Added CSS diagnostic tools for better debugging

Despite these changes, UI styling remains inconsistent, especially in the development environment, indicating a more fundamental architecture issue.

### Modular Architecture Planning (March 19, 2025)

We've created a comprehensive modular architecture plan document (MODULAR_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md) that covers:

1. Implementation phases for Next.js route groups
2. CSS strategy with module-specific configurations
3. Data sharing approach between modules
4. API contracts for inter-module communication
5. Local development workflow improvements
6. Risk management and contingency planning
7. User experience continuity during migration
8. Performance metrics and monitoring
9. Team structure recommendations

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions (Week 1)**:

   - Create route group structure for admin module first
   - Implement module-specific CSS configuration for admin
   - Test and verify admin module deployment independently
   - Establish baseline performance metrics

2. **Short-term Actions (Weeks 2-3)**:

   - Develop shared component library with explicit interfaces
   - Migrate additional modules to route group structure
   - Implement API contracts between modules
   - Create CI/CD workflows for modular testing

3. **Medium-term Vision**:
   - Complete module migration for all application sections
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring
   - Refine developer experience for modular workflow

## Development Environment

This project is configured to run on localhost:3001. Always check server status before starting and terminate running server before invoking the build command.

## Active Decisions

- **Architecture Strategy**: Moving from monolithic to modular architecture using Next.js route groups
- **CSS Approach**: Module-specific CSS with shared design tokens
- **Deployment Strategy**: Independent module builds and deployments
- **Immediate Focus**: Admin module migration as first priority due to current build issues
- **Mobile-first Approach**: All UI development must maintain mobile responsiveness

## Considerations

- **Migration Timeline**: Balance between comprehensive solution and immediate deployment needs
- **Team Organization**: Consider reorganizing team structure around modules
- **Learning Curve**: Additional complexity of modular development workflow
- **Performance Impact**: Monitor performance during and after transition
- **User Experience**: Maintain consistent UX during incremental migration
