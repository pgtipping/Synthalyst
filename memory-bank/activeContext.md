- `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/delete/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/update-status/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/update-notes/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/route.ts`

The fix involved changing the context parameter from:

```typescript
context: {
  params: {
    id: string;
  }
}
```

to:

```typescript
{ params }: { params: { id: string } }
```

This change aligns with Next.js 15.2.0's API route handler signature requirements.

## 2024-03-05: Next.js 15.2.0 Compatibility Fixes

We've successfully resolved several compatibility issues with Next.js 15.2.0 that were preventing successful deployment:

1. **API Route Handler Params Type Fix**:

   - Updated all dynamic API route handlers to use `Promise<{ id: string }>` for the params type
   - Modified code to properly await params before accessing them
   - This fixed the error: "Type '{ params: { id: string; }; }' is not a valid type for the function's second argument"
   - Affected files:
     - `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/delete/route.ts`
     - `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/route.ts`
     - `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/update-notes/route.ts`
     - `src/app/api/admin/contact-submissions/[id]/update-status/route.ts`

2. **Metadata Type Definition Fix**:

   - Created a custom type definition file for Next.js Metadata
   - This allowed us to keep existing import statements (`import { Metadata } from "next"`)
   - Fixed the error: "Module 'next' has no exported member 'Metadata'"
   - Added file: `src/types/next-metadata.d.ts`

3. **NextApiRequest/NextApiResponse Import Fix**:
   - Updated imports from "next" to "next/server" in API handlers
   - Changed `NextApiRequest` to `NextRequest` and `NextApiResponse` to `NextResponse`
   - Modified request handling to use App Router patterns (await req.json(), return NextResponse.json())
   - Fixed the error: "Module 'next' has no exported member 'NextApiRequest'"
   - Updated file: `src/app/api/llama.ts`

These fixes ensure compatibility with Next.js 15.2.0 and allow successful deployment to Vercel.

## Integrated HR Toolkit Implementation - 2025-03-06

We are currently implementing the integrated HR toolkit, which will create a unified ecosystem centered around competencies. This integration will enable seamless workflows between the Competency Manager, Competency Matrix Creator, JD Developer, Interview Questions Generator, and Training Plan Creator.

### Current Focus

1. **Database Integration**:

   - We have implemented the database schema for the integrated HR toolkit, including competency frameworks, competencies, competency levels, and organizational reference data.
   - We have created a migration for the schema changes and seeded the database with initial reference data.

2. **API Implementation**:

   - We have enhanced the competency manager API to support integration with reference data.
   - We have created API endpoints for managing reference data (competency categories, industries).

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Update the frontend to use the new API endpoints
   - Implement the UI for selecting industries and categories when creating competency frameworks
   - Add support for competency matrices

### Implementation Approach

We are following a phased approach to ensure backward compatibility and minimize disruption to existing functionality:

1. **Phase 1**: Foundation (Database schema and API endpoints)
2. **Phase 1.5**: Organizational Reference Data
3. **Phase 2**: Enhanced JD Developer
4. **Phase 3**: Competency Manager
5. **Phase 4**: Competency Matrix Creator
6. **Phase 5**: Enhanced Interview Questions Generator
7. **Phase 6**: Training Plan Creator Integration

We are currently in Phase 1.5, focusing on implementing the organizational reference data and enhancing the competency manager API.

## Vercel Deployment Fix - 2025-03-06

We've fixed a critical issue that was preventing successful deployment to Vercel:

### Issue Details

- The deployment was failing with a TypeScript error in the competency-categories API route
- The error was related to accessing `session.user.role` in the API routes, but the TypeScript type definition for the session user object didn't include the `role` property
- This was causing the build to fail during the type-checking phase

### Solution Implemented

- Updated the NextAuth.js type definitions in `nextjs-app/src/types/next-auth.d.ts` to include the `role` property in:
  - The `Session` interface
  - The `User` interface
  - The `JWT` interface
- This ensures that TypeScript recognizes the `role` property when it's accessed in the API routes
- The fix aligns the type definitions with the actual implementation in the `auth.ts` file, where the role is added to the session user object in the `session` callback

### Next Steps

- Monitor the Vercel deployment to ensure it completes successfully
- Consider implementing a more comprehensive type-checking process in the CI/CD pipeline to catch similar issues before they reach production
- Review other areas of the codebase where session properties might be accessed to ensure proper type definitions

## Scripts TypeScript Configuration Fix - 2025-03-06

We've improved the TypeScript configuration for the scripts directory to enhance type safety and fix linter errors:

### Issue Details

- The `nextjs-app/scripts/tsconfig.json` file had two main issues:
  - It was missing the `strict` option, which is recommended for better type safety
  - It lacked type definitions for `testing-library__jest-dom`, causing TypeScript errors

### Solution Implemented

- Updated the `tsconfig.json` file with the following improvements:
  - Added the `strict` option to enable comprehensive type checking
  - Added `typeRoots` configuration to include custom type definitions
  - Specified `node` in the `types` array to ensure Node.js types are available
- Created a custom type definition file for `testing-library__jest-dom` in `scripts/types/testing-library__jest-dom.d.ts`
- Installed `@types/testing-library__jest-dom` as a dev dependency

### Benefits

- Enhanced type safety for all scripts in the project
- Eliminated TypeScript errors related to missing type definitions
- Improved developer experience with better type checking
- Established a pattern for handling custom type definitions in the project

### Next Steps

- Consider applying similar type safety improvements to other parts of the codebase
- Review other TypeScript configuration files for potential enhancements
- Document the custom type definition pattern in the project guidelines
