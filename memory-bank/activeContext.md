# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus

We are currently focused on standardizing the mock Prisma client pattern for API tests. This involves:

1. Ensuring all API tests that use Prisma follow a consistent pattern
2. Implementing proper TypeScript interfaces for the mock Prisma client
3. Ensuring all tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases
4. Maintaining test isolation to prevent test interference

## Recent Changes

- Fixed Vercel deployment failures by verifying components using React hooks are only used on the client side
- Fixed linter errors in the mock Prisma client implementation
- Standardized the mock Prisma client pattern for API tests
  - Updated Categories API tests to use the standardized pattern
  - Updated Posts API tests to use the standardized pattern
  - Created new API tests for JD Developer API (save and delete endpoints)
  - Created new API tests for 2Do API (tasks and tasks/[id] endpoints)
  - Created new API tests for Auth API (signup endpoint)
  - Verified that other API test files (chat, training-plan, learning-content, interview-questions) do not use Prisma and don't require updates
- Enhanced the mock Prisma client implementation to support JobDescription, Task, and TaskTag models

## Next Steps

1. Run the test suite to verify all tests pass
2. Complete any remaining enhancements for the JD Developer API
3. Consider adding tests for any remaining API endpoints that use Prisma
4. Update documentation to reflect the standardized testing approach

## Active Decisions

- We've decided to use a standardized mock Prisma client pattern for all API tests that interact with the database
- The mock Prisma client is set up in the Jest environment and made available globally
- Each test file mocks the Prisma import to use the global mock client
- Tests should reset the mock storage before each test to ensure isolation

## Considerations

- The mock Prisma client should be kept in sync with the actual Prisma schema
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
