## Current Focus (2023-07-10)

### Audio Recording Functionality

We've implemented significant improvements to the audio recording functionality:

1. **Server-side Storage**: Audio files are now stored on the server rather than relying on client-side downloads, which were failing in localhost environments.

2. **API Routes**: Created `/api/audio` endpoints for uploading and downloading audio files.

3. **MediaRecorder Fixes**: Resolved issues with the MediaRecorder API, including:

   - Setting appropriate MIME types
   - Proper error handling
   - Improved blob handling

4. **Testing**: Added comprehensive tests for the AudioRecorder component and API routes.

5. **User Experience**: Improved the recording experience with:
   - Progress bar showing recording duration
   - Timer display
   - Clear status indicators
   - Better error messages

### Next Steps

1. Implement audio playback improvements
2. Add audio file management (listing, deleting)
3. Integrate audio recording with other components
4. Add audio transcription functionality
