# Active Context - 2024-03-01

## Current Focus - 2024-03-01

We have successfully resolved the Vercel deployment issues by:

1. Adding "use client" directive to components using React hooks:

   - InterviewQuestionsForm.tsx
   - TemplateSearch.tsx
   - TemplateCategories.tsx
   - Other client components using hooks

2. Fixed Babel and SWC compiler conflicts by:

   - Moving Babel configuration to a test-specific file
   - Updating Jest configuration to use the test-specific Babel config
   - Ensuring Next.js can use its SWC compiler for production builds

3. Fixed linter errors in the mock Prisma client implementation:
   - Added TypeScript interfaces for mock storage
   - Replaced `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Improved type safety in the mock implementation
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/lib/test/prisma-mock.ts`

The current focus is on standardizing the mock Prisma client pattern for API tests. This involves:

1. Creating reusable mock implementations for other database entities
2. Ensuring consistent error handling across mock implementations
3. Documenting the pattern in .cursorrules
4. Applying the pattern to all API tests

We have successfully applied the standardized mock Prisma client pattern to:

- Categories API tests
- Posts API tests

After reviewing the codebase, we've determined that the other API test files (`chat.test.ts`, `training-plan.test.ts`, `learning-content.test.ts`, and `interview-questions/generate/route.test.ts`) don't use Prisma at all, so they don't need to be updated. The `stress.test.ts` file is using the actual Prisma client, which is appropriate for stress testing the database.

The next steps are to create new API tests for:

- JD Developer API tests (to be created)
- 2Do API tests (to be created)
- Auth API tests (to be created)

## Recent Changes - 2024-03-01

   - Added "use client" directive to components using React hooks
   - Resolved Babel configuration conflicts with Next.js SWC compiler
   - Verified all components are properly separated into client/server components

2. Fixed mock Prisma client implementation:

   - Added TypeScript interfaces for mock storage
   - Replaced `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Improved type safety in the mock implementation
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/lib/test/prisma-mock.ts`

3. Standardized mock Prisma client pattern:

   - Updated Categories API tests to use the standardized pattern
   - Updated Posts API tests to use the standardized pattern
   - Documented the pattern in .cursorrules
   - Added examples for handling relationships and API route params

4. Verified ESLint and TypeScript errors:
   - Ran `npm run lint` to verify no ESLint errors
   - Ran `npm run typecheck` to verify no TypeScript errors
