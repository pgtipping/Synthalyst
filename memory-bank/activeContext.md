   - Created error handling pages (not-found.tsx, error.tsx, global-error.tsx)
   - This resolves the type error: "Type '{ params: { id: string; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'"

2. ✅ FIXED: Missing exports in gemini.ts:

   - Added the missing `fetchResourcesWithGemini` function export that was being imported in the enhanced-generate route
   - Added the missing `getGeminiModel` function export that was being imported in the modelComparison.ts file
   - Refactored the existing code to use the new `getGeminiModel` function for better consistency
   - This ensures that all components using Gemini functionality can properly access the required functions
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/lib/gemini.ts`

3. ✅ FIXED: Type error in regenerate-section route:

   - Updated the POST function's second parameter type from `{ params }` to `context: { params: { id: string } }`
   - Fixed the parameter reference from `params.id` to `context.params.id`
   - This resolves the type error: "Type '{ params: { id: string; }; }' is not a valid type for the function's second argument"
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/api/training-plan/[id]/regenerate-section/route.ts`

4. ✅ COMMITTED: Changes pushed to main branch:

# Active Context (2024-03-02)

## Current Focus (2024-03-02)

The current focus is on maintaining the stability of the application after successfully resolving Vercel deployment failures that occurred after upgrading the shadcn UI components. We've identified and permanently fixed two critical issues:

1. ✅ RESOLVED: Toast implementation migration completed:

   - Successfully migrated all components from the old toast system to the new sonner toast system
   - Created and implemented a comprehensive toast migration utility at `@/lib/toast-migration.ts` that provides backward compatibility
   - Verified that all components now import toast from `@/lib/toast-migration` instead of `@/hooks/use-toast`
   - Confirmed that the toast migration utility properly supports the `variant: "destructive"` property
   - Updated the layout.tsx file to use the new Toaster component from `@/components/ui/sonner`
   - This ensures consistent error handling and user feedback throughout the application
   - This issue is now completely resolved and won't recur in future development

2. ✅ RESOLVED: Duplicate keyframes in tailwind.config.ts fixed:

   - Permanently removed duplicate 'accordion-down' and 'accordion-up' keyframes definitions
   - Removed duplicate animation entries
   - Verified that the tailwind.config.ts file now has only one definition for each keyframe and animation
   - This resolved the build error: "An object literal cannot have multiple properties with the same name"
   - This issue is now completely resolved and won't recur in future development

3. ✅ ENHANCED: Interview Questions Generator UI improvements:

   - Redesigned the scoring rubric display with a more professional and consistent look
   - Replaced the green color scheme and star ratings with a clean, indigo-based design that matches the other tabs
   - Created a new `generateProfessionalRubricHtml` function in the API route to ensure consistent styling
   - Updated the component CSS to rely on Tailwind classes for better maintainability
   - Improved mobile responsiveness for all elements of the Interview Questions Generator
   - Enhanced the visual hierarchy and readability of the scoring rubric
   - Ensured a consistent design language across all tabs (Questions, Evaluation Tips, Scoring Rubric)
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/app/api/interview-questions/generate/route.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/interview-questions/components/InterviewQuestionsForm.tsx`

4. ✅ UPDATED: Gemini model version in model comparison tool:
   - Updated the Gemini model to use the latest "gemini-2.0-flash" version in `gemini.ts`
   - Verified that the model comparison tool in `modelComparison.ts` is correctly using the updated model
   - Confirmed that all other references to Gemini in the codebase are using the `getGeminiModel()` function
   - Checked that the enhanced training plan generator in `enhanced-generate/route.ts` is using the updated model
   - Ensured that environment variables are correctly set up to use the `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - This update ensures that all components using Gemini are using the latest model version
   - Location: `nextjs-app/src/lib/gemini.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/model-comparison/modelComparison.ts`, `nextjs-app/src/app/api/training-plan/enhanced-generate/route.ts`

These changes have successfully fixed the Vercel deployment issues, and the application is now building and deploying correctly with all the new shadcn UI components. A thorough code review has confirmed that all components are using the correct imports and there are no remaining instances of the old toast system.

Previously, the focus was on fixing a Vercel deployment failure caused by a missing GROQ_API_KEY environment variable. The build was failing with the error: "The GROQ_API_KEY environment variable is missing or empty". We've implemented the following fixes:

1. Improved error handling in the Interview Questions Generator API route:

   - Added conditional initialization of the Groq client only when the API key is available
   - Implemented a fallback mechanism to provide sample questions when the LLM service is unavailable
   - Enhanced error responses to be more user-friendly and informative

2. Updated the client-side component to handle API configuration errors gracefully:

   - Added specific handling for 503 Service Unavailable responses
   - Improved error message display to provide better guidance to users

3. Updated documentation:
   - Enhanced the .env.example file with clearer instructions about the GROQ_API_KEY requirement
   - Added notes about setting this variable in the Vercel environment

These changes ensure that the application can build successfully even when environment variables are missing, and provides a better user experience when services are unavailable.

Previously, the focus was on fixing the Interview Questions Generator to properly display questions, evaluation tips, and scoring rubrics. We've identified and resolved issues with JSON parsing and display in the Interview Questions Generator. The main problems were:

1. Complex JSON parsing logic in the API route with multiple fallback mechanisms that were causing confusion
2. Multiple extraction methods that weren't working together consistently
3. Inconsistent response handling in the component
4. Complex HTML handling in the scoring rubric

We've simplified the solution by:

1. Changing the LLM prompt to request a clearly structured response with section headers (QUESTIONS:, EVALUATION TIPS:, SCORING RUBRIC:) instead of JSON
2. Implementing a simpler section-based extraction approach in the API route
3. Removing unnecessary filtering in the component that might have been filtering out valid content
4. Simplifying the HTML generation for the scoring rubric
5. Improving error handling to show more specific error messages
6. Adding better empty state handling in the UI

Previously, the focus was on fixing accessibility and linter errors in the test files, specifically addressing ARIA role issues in the InterviewQuestionsForm.test.tsx file. We've fixed a linter error related to ARIA roles where a `<li>` element with `role="option"` needed to be contained within a parent element that has either the "group" or "listbox" role. The solution was to remove both the `role="option"` and `aria-selected` attributes from the `<li>` element in the SelectItem mock component, as these attributes were causing accessibility violations in the test environment.

Previously, the focus was on fixing display issues in the Interview Questions Generator, specifically addressing a problem where evaluation tips were showing after the questions instead of in their dedicated tab. We've improved the JSON parsing in the API route to better handle malformed responses from the LLM, enhanced the extraction function to better separate tips from questions, updated the prompt to ensure the LLM returns properly formatted JSON, and added filtering in the UI component to ensure tips don't appear in the questions tab.

Previously, the focus was on upgrading Shadcn UI to the latest version. We've replaced the outdated shadcn-ui and @shadcn/ui packages with the new shadcn package. We've updated all existing UI components to their latest versions and added new components like Carousel, Drawer, and Command. We've also replaced the deprecated toast component with the new sonner component and created a migration utility to ensure backward compatibility with existing code.

Previously, the focus was on fixing TypeScript errors in the Interview Questions Generator that were causing build failures in Vercel deployment. We've added proper type annotations to callback parameters in filter and map functions throughout the file, replacing implicit 'any' types with explicit string and unknown types where appropriate. This ensures type safety and prevents build failures in production.

Previously, the focus was on fixing a critical security issue where the Groq API key was being exposed to the client. We've replaced all instances of `NEXT_PUBLIC_GROQ_API_KEY` with the server-side only `GROQ_API_KEY` to ensure that API keys are never exposed to the client. This change affects multiple API routes including the llama.ts, learning-content, 2do/process-voice, competency-manager, and training-plan routes. We've also updated the .env.example files to remove any references to public API keys.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the Interview Questions Generator by redesigning the UI to clearly separate questions, evaluation tips, and scoring rubrics. We've implemented a tabbed interface that organizes the generated content into distinct sections, making it easier for users to navigate between different types of content. This redesign addresses the issue where the output was mixed up and not properly separated, providing a much better user experience.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the Interview Questions Generator by implementing two additional features: evaluation tips and scoring rubrics. These features were specified in the project brief but had not yet been implemented. The evaluation tips provide guidance on how to evaluate responses to each interview question, while the scoring rubric offers a comprehensive framework for scoring all responses. These additions make the Interview Questions Generator a more complete and valuable tool for users conducting interviews.

Previously, the focus was on integrating the Interview Questions Generator into the main application. We've replaced the 2Do Task Manager card on the home page with the Interview Questions Generator card, making this feature more accessible to users directly from the home page. This change helps highlight the new functionality and provides users with easier access to this tool.

Previously, the focus was on improving the UI readability by changing all grey/silver text to black throughout the application. This change was implemented across multiple pages and components to ensure consistent readability and better user experience. We've updated the global CSS file to modify default text colors and then systematically updated individual components where specific grey text classes were used.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the application's analytics capabilities by adding Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights. This will help track user interactions, monitor performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement. We've successfully integrated both Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights into the application's root layout to ensure all pages are tracked. We've also fixed an import path issue with the SpeedInsights component, changing it from '@vercel/speed-insights/next' to '@vercel/speed-insights/react'.

Previous focus was on improving the JD Developer component's user experience and fixing template filtering issues. We've enhanced the template guide with better styling and clearer instructions about required fields. We've also fixed an issue where templates were appearing in both the templates list and the saved job descriptions list by improving the filtering logic in the API endpoints. Most recently, we've improved the loading state UI for the templates tab to provide a smoother and more consistent user experience.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

- Fixed inconsistencies in the Gemini API integration in `nextjs-app/src/lib/gemini.ts`
- Updated Memory Bank documentation to reflect the correct API usage patterns
- Added detailed examples and guidelines to `.cursorrules` for future reference

## Next Steps - 2024-03-08 16:10

1. Continue monitoring the performance of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model for resource recommendations
2. Consider implementing additional validation for the resources returned by the Gemini API
3. Explore opportunities to further optimize the prompts for both Gemini and Llama models
4. Ensure all environment variables are properly documented in `.env.example` files

## Active Decisions - 2024-03-08 16:15

1. **LLM Selection Strategy**:

   - Use Gemini 2.0 Flash for resource recommendations due to its knowledge of current resources and ability to follow structured output formats
   - Use Llama 3.2 3b for plan generation due to its strong reasoning capabilities and cost-effectiveness

2. **API Integration Pattern**:

   - Maintain utility functions (`getGeminiModel()`, `openRouter` instance) for consistent API access
   - Use Zod schemas for validating structured outputs from LLMs
   - Implement robust error handling for all LLM API calls

3. **Environment Variable Naming**:
   - Standardize on `GEMINI_API_KEY` for the Google Generative AI API
   - Maintain `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` for the OpenRouter API
   - Ensure all `.env.example` files reflect the current naming conventions

## Current Focus (2023-06-15)

### Training Plan Creator PDF Export Feature

We've enhanced the Training Plan Creator by replacing the HTML export functionality with a more professional PDF export feature. This improvement provides users with a better way to share and print their training plans.

Key changes:

- Created a new `TrainingPlanPDF.tsx` component that renders training plans as PDF documents
- Integrated with the existing `@react-pdf/renderer` library already used in the JD Developer component
- Updated both the PlanForm and SavedPlansTab components to use the new PDF export functionality
- Added proper error handling and user feedback for the PDF generation process
- Ensured the PDF includes all relevant information: title, content, resources, and creation date
- Styled the PDF to match the application's design language

This enhancement improves the user experience by providing a more professional and shareable output format for training plans.

### PDF Font Issue Fix

We've fixed an issue with the PDF export feature where custom fonts were failing to load, resulting in an "Unknown font format" error. The error occurred because the specified font files (`/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf` and `/fonts/Inter-Bold.ttf`) were not found in the public directory.

Key changes:

- Removed the custom font registration using `Font.register()`
- Switched to using the standard "Helvetica" font that's built into the PDF renderer
- Updated font weight specifications from numeric values (700) to string values ("bold")
- Ensured the PDF generation works reliably without requiring external font files

This fix ensures that users can successfully generate and download PDF versions of their training plans without encountering font-related errors.

### PDF Formatting Issue Fix (2023-06-16)

We've addressed a formatting issue in the PDF export for training plans where content was being duplicated and sections weren't properly separated. The problem was in the content parsing logic of the `TrainingPlanPDF` component.

Key changes:

- Improved the section extraction algorithm to better handle the training plan format
- Fixed the regex pattern used to identify section headings
- Implemented a more robust approach to splitting content by main section numbers
- Added conditional rendering for section headings to prevent empty headings
- Removed unused variables to address linter warnings

This fix ensures that the PDF exports have proper formatting with clear section separation, making the training plans more professional and readable for users.
