## Current Focus

We are currently focused on optimizing the LLM model usage in the Synthalyst web application, specifically for the Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator features. The goal is to improve cost efficiency while maintaining or enhancing output quality, and to create a more user-friendly multilingual experience.

## Recent Changes

### Model Optimization Implementation

We have implemented a cost-optimized combination strategy for the Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator features:

1. **Primary Models**:

   - Knowledge GPT: Switched to Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B for better cost efficiency
   - Learning Creator: Switched to GPT-4o-Mini for balanced cost and quality

2. **Tiered Approach**:

   - Created a model router service that selects the appropriate model based on task complexity, content length, language support, and cost priority
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for API failures

3. **Multilingual Support**:

   - Added language selection to both features
   - Implemented language detection from browser settings
   - Updated system prompts to support multilingual responses

4. **UI Improvements**:

   - Added language selector component
   - Improved error handling and display
   - Enhanced content display with model information

5. **Database Updates**:
   - Added language and modelUsed fields to KnowledgeEntry and LearningContentEntry models

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**:

   - Test with various languages and complexity levels
   - Validate cost savings and output quality

2. **User Feedback**:

   - Collect feedback on multilingual support
   - Adjust based on user preferences

3. **Analytics**:
   - Implement analytics to track model usage
   - Use data to further optimize the selection algorithm

## Active Decisions

1. **Model Selection Strategy**:

   - Use Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model for Knowledge GPT
   - Use GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model for Learning Creator
   - Dynamically select models based on task requirements

2. **Language Support**:

   - Support all languages available in the selected models
   - Default to browser language when possible
   - Fall back to more capable models for unsupported languages

3. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Prioritize cost efficiency for simple tasks
   - Use more capable models for complex tasks
   - Monitor usage and adjust thresholds as needed
