# Active Development Context [2024-07-10 15:45:00]

## Current Focus

### Vercel Build Error Fixes [2024-07-10 15:45:00]

We have successfully fixed several build errors that were preventing successful deployment on Vercel:

1. **Missing "use client" Directives**:

   - Added the "use client" directive to `Breadcrumb.tsx` which was using the `usePathname` hook
   - Added the "use client" directive to `RedisMonitoring.tsx` which was using `useEffect` and `useState` hooks
   - These components were failing to build because client-side React hooks cannot be used in server components

2. **Missing Dependencies**:

   - Installed the `@upstash/ratelimit` package which was missing and causing a build error
   - This dependency is required for the rate limiting functionality in the API routes

3. **Toast Implementation Fixes**:
   - Updated the toast calls in `RedisMonitoring.tsx` to use the correct Sonner API format
   - Changed from object-based toast calls to method-based calls (`toast.success()` and `toast.error()`)
   - Removed unused error parameters and fixed variable naming

These changes have been committed and pushed to the repository, which should resolve the Vercel build errors and allow successful deployment.

### ApplyRight and Interview Prep Integration [2024-07-10 10:30:00]

   - Implemented storage of job details, resume text, and timestamp in localStorage
   - Added a "Next Steps" section with cards for Interview Prep and Career Bundle
   - Updated the link to Interview Prep to include a query parameter `?from=applyright`

2. **Interview Prep Enhancements**:

   - Added detection of data coming from ApplyRight using the query parameter
   - Implemented a timestamp system to track when data was imported
   - Added a prominent notification card when data is imported from ApplyRight
   - Created functionality to clear imported data if needed
   - Added a back button to return to ApplyRight

3. **Data Sharing Implementation**:
   - When a user transforms their resume in ApplyRight, the job details and resume text are stored in localStorage
   - A timestamp is also stored to track when the data was imported
   - The Interview Prep page detects the imported data and displays a notification
   - The job details form is pre-filled with the imported data

### ApplyRight Implementation - June 14, 2023

We've successfully implemented the core components of the ApplyRight feature:

1. **Document Parsing**: Created a utility for extracting text from various document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) using:

   - mammoth for Word documents (DOC, DOCX)
   - react-pdftotext for PDF documents
   - Native File API for text files

2. **User Interface Components**:

   - `FileUpload`: Handles file uploads and document parsing
   - `JobDescription`: Allows users to input job descriptions
   - `ResumePreview`: Displays the transformed resume
   - `CoverLetterPreview`: Displays the generated cover letter
   - `HowItWorks`: Explains the ApplyRight process
   - `FeaturesSection`: Showcases the features of ApplyRight
   - `PricingSection`: Displays pricing tiers and handles premium upgrades

3. **API Integration**: Implemented the API route for transforming resumes using the Gemini API.

4. **User Flow**:

   - Optionally add job description
   - Transform resume
   - View and download transformed resume and cover letter

### Known Issues and Limitations

1. **PDF Support**: PDF parsing is implemented using react-pdftotext with dynamic imports to ensure it only runs on the client side. This approach avoids server-side rendering issues with the PDF.js dependency.

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add more export format options
   - Enhance the resume transformation algorithm
   - Implement premium features for authenticated users

## Recent Changes (2025-03-12)

2. **Premium Features**: Implement the premium features for authenticated users.
3. **Export Options**: Add more export format options (DOCX, PDF).
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback from users and make improvements.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Document Parsing**: We've decided to temporarily disable PDF support to ensure the feature works reliably. We'll need to investigate a more robust solution for PDF parsing in the future.
- **API Integration**: We're using the Gemini API for resume transformation, which provides good results but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases.
- **User Experience**: We've designed the UI to guide users through the process with clear steps and feedback.
- **Error Handling**: We've implemented comprehensive error handling to provide clear feedback to users when issues occur.

- Use dynamic imports for components not needed on initial load
- Implement code splitting for large components
- Optimize third-party scripts loading
- Implement Web Workers for CPU-intensive tasks

### 4. Add Source Maps for Better Debugging

- Configure webpack to generate source maps in production
- Implement proper error boundaries and logging

### 5. Implement SEO Optimizations

- Add comprehensive meta tags to all pages
- Implement JSON-LD schema for rich snippets
- Generate sitemap.xml
- Configure robots.txt
- Optimize images with proper alt tags and lazy loading

## Implementation Timeline [2025-03-12 20:16:00]

1. **Week 1**: Address accessibility issues and implement critical CSS optimizations
2. **Week 2**: Optimize JavaScript execution and implement code splitting
3. **Week 3**: Implement SEO optimizations and source maps
4. **Week 4**: Test and refine all optimizations

## Accessibility Improvement Progress [2025-03-12 20:20:00]

We've successfully addressed all the accessibility issues identified in the audit:

### Completed Improvements

1. Fixed color contrast in the Footer component:

   - Updated text color from text-gray-500 to text-gray-300 for better contrast against the dark background
   - This ensures that footer text and links meet WCAG contrast ratio standards

2. Updated navigation links in the Header component:

   - Changed text color from text-muted-foreground to text-gray-700 for better contrast
   - This improves readability of navigation links throughout the application

3. Modified the Button component:

   - Updated the primary button variant to use text-white instead of text-primary-foreground
   - Changed the link variant to use text-gray-900 instead of text-primary
   - These changes ensure better contrast for button text

4. Updated the primary color in globals.css:

   - Changed from --primary: 221.2 83.2% 53.3% to --primary: 221.2 83.2% 43.3%
   - This darker shade provides better contrast against light backgrounds

5. Fixed specific components with contrast issues:
   - Updated the Contact Sales button in PricingSection to use text-gray-900 and border-gray-400
   - Changed the Login button in Header from variant="ghost" to variant="outline" with text-gray-900
   - Updated the Breadcrumb component to use text-gray-700 instead of text-muted-foreground

### Results

- Accessibility audit now shows a perfect score of 100/100
- All color contrast issues have been resolved
- The application now meets WCAG contrast ratio standards
- All text elements are now clearly readable against their backgrounds

### Next Steps

Now that we've addressed the accessibility issues, we'll focus on implementing the performance optimizations outlined in our plan:

1. Reduce render-blocking resources
2. Improve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
3. Reduce JavaScript execution time
4. Add source maps for better debugging
5. Implement SEO optimizations
