## Current Focus (March 15, 2025)

The current focus is on implementing model optimization for the Synthalyst platform. This involves:

1. Standardizing model usage across the platform
2. Removing model information from the UI
3. Implementing a tiered approach for model selection
4. Enhancing multilingual support

## Recent Changes (March 15, 2025)

- Removed model information from the UI in Knowledge GPT and Learning Content Creator pages
- Updated model-router.ts to use generic model types (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL and LEARNING_MODEL)
- Standardized language support across the platform
- Fixed linter errors related to unused imports

## Next Steps (March 15, 2025)

- Implement backend model routing logic based on task complexity
- Add cost optimization features for model selection
- Enhance error handling for API calls
- Implement user preference settings for language selection
- Add analytics for model usage tracking

## Active Decisions (March 15, 2025)

- Using Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model for Knowledge GPT
- Using GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model for Learning Creator
- Implementing a tiered approach for model selection based on:
  - Task complexity
  - Content length
  - Language support
  - Cost priority
- Standardizing language support across all tools
