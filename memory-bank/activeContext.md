# Active Development Context - 2024-02-28

## Current Focus: API Test Improvements (2024-02-28 23:15)

### Categories API Tests

#### Recent Changes

- Implemented a mock Prisma client for testing the Categories API
- Created test cases for both GET and POST endpoints
- Fixed type issues in the mock implementation
- Added proper error handling for Prisma errors
- Implemented proper response structure validation
- Fixed NextRequest mocking in test environment
- Resolved linter errors in test files
- Successfully implemented tests for:
  - Empty category lists
  - Pagination functionality
  - Search query filtering
  - Category creation
  - Required field validation
  - Duplicate category prevention

#### Current Issues

- Linter errors in the mock Prisma client implementation
  - Multiple "Unexpected any" type errors
  - Need to add proper TypeScript interfaces for mock storage
- Need to improve error handling in the mock implementation
- Need to standardize the mock implementation pattern for other API tests

### Interview Questions Generator

#### Recent Changes

- Set up basic test infrastructure
- Implemented form validation
- Added accessibility attributes to form components
- Added error handling for API failures
- Fixed tests for the InterviewQuestionsForm component
  - Implemented proper Button mock with data-disabled attribute
  - Created helper functions to simulate loading states
  - Added proper toast notification testing
  - Fixed useState mock implementation
  - Added tests for clearing generated questions
- Fixed the NextResponse.json mock implementation in jest.setup.js to properly handle its usage in route handlers
- Resolved "Response.json is not a function" error in API tests
- Set up proper mocking for NextResponse in the test environment
- Implemented Training Plan API tests that now pass successfully
- Improved test infrastructure for API route testing
- Created and fixed API tests for the Interview Questions Generator
  - Implemented proper mocking of Groq SDK
  - Added tests for success and error cases
  - Fixed environment variable handling in tests
  - Documented API testing patterns in .cursorrules
- Fixed the Chat API tests by properly mocking the Botpress client
- Implemented a pattern for mocking external API clients in tests
- Added global mock storage to handle Jest's hoisting behavior
- Ensured all error cases are properly tested

#### Current Issues

- Other API tests still failing with "Request is not defined" error
- Some Prisma-related test failures in the test environment ("PrismaClient is unable to run in this browser environment")
- Need to improve error handling in API routes
- Database-related tests (Categories API) are failing with Prisma browser environment errors
- Need to improve error handling in API routes that use Prisma

### JD Developer

#### Recent Changes

- Added optional salary fields to the form
- Implemented salary field reset functionality
- Fixed issue with LLM returning null for salary data
- Added form validation for salary fields
- Added tests for salary field functionality
- Enhanced salary field functionality
- Added toast notifications for feedback

#### Current Issues

- Need to improve error handling for LLM salary data
- Need to add loading states for salary field generation
- Need to complete test coverage for salary-related features
- Salary field needs additional validation
- Form submission needs better error handling
- Need to add more comprehensive tests

## Active Decisions

### Testing Strategy

- Decided to implement comprehensive test coverage before new feature development
- Using Jest and React Testing Library for component testing
- Focus on accessibility in test implementation
- Balance between unit tests and integration tests
- Using helper functions to manually simulate component states in tests
- Using data attributes for testing component states
- Use proper mocking for Next.js components and functions
- Implement comprehensive API tests
- Focus on testing business logic rather than UI interactions
- Ensure proper error handling in tests
- **Mock Prisma client for database-related tests**
- **Use in-memory storage for mock data in tests**
- **Implement proper error handling for database operations**

### Form Component Architecture

- Using Shadcn UI components with custom wrappers
- Implementing proper accessibility attributes
- Standardizing error handling across forms
- Using react-hook-form for form management
- Use React Hook Form with Zod validation
- Implement consistent error handling
- Use toast notifications for feedback
- Ensure accessibility compliance

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks

1. Fix linter errors in mock Prisma client implementation

   - Add proper TypeScript interfaces for mock storage
   - Replace `any` types with specific interfaces
   - Improve type safety in mock implementation

2. Standardize mock Prisma client pattern for other API tests

   - Create reusable mock implementations for other database entities
   - Ensure consistent error handling across mock implementations
   - Document the pattern in .cursorrules

3. JD Developer Enhancements

   - Add tests for salary field edge cases
   - Implement better error handling for LLM salary data
   - Add loading states for salary field generation
   - Complete test coverage
   - Add salary range validation

4. Shared Components

   - Extract common form components
   - Standardize test mocks
   - Create reusable test utilities

5. Enhance JD Developer form validation

6. Standardize shared components across features

7. Improve error handling in API routes

### Technical Considerations

- Need to maintain consistent error handling patterns
- Need to ensure accessibility across all form components
- Need to optimize test setup for faster execution
- Need to implement proper loading states for all async operations
- Consider using data attributes for testing component states
- Ensure proper mocking of Next.js components and functions
- Address JSDOM limitations in tests
- Implement consistent error handling across the application
- Ensure proper type safety with TypeScript
- **Standardize database mock implementations**
- **Improve error handling for database operations**
- **Ensure proper typing for mock implementations**
