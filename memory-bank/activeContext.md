## Current Focus (March 15, 2025)

The current focus is on optimizing LLM model usage for the Synthalyst platform, particularly for the Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator features. The goal is to achieve cost efficiency while providing excellent multilingual experiences.

### Recent Changes

1. **Model Information Removal from UI**: Removed model information from the UI to simplify the user experience and focus on functionality rather than technical details.
2. **Language Selector Fix**: Fixed issues with the language selector component to properly handle language changes and ensure they're passed to the API.
3. **Model Router Updates**:
   - Added a new `generateContentV2` function with improved parameter handling
   - Updated the API route to use the new function
   - Standardized language support across models
   - Fixed Gemini API integration to properly handle system messages (Gemini doesn't support system role)
4. **UI Simplification**: Streamlined both Knowledge GPT and Learning Content Creator pages for better user experience.

### Next Steps

1. **Backend Model Routing Logic**: Implement sophisticated model routing logic based on task complexity, content length, and language.
2. **Cost Optimization Features**: Add features to track and optimize model usage costs.
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improve error handling for API calls and model responses.
4. **User Preference Settings**: Implement user preference settings for language selection.
5. **Analytics Implementation**: Add analytics to track model usage and performance.

### Active Decisions

1. **Model Selection**:
   - Using **Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B** for Knowledge GPT
   - Using **GPT-4o-Mini** for Learning Creator
2. **Tiered Approach**: Implementing a tiered approach for model selection based on:
   - Task complexity
   - Content length
   - Language support
   - Cost priority
3. **Language Support**:
   - Standardized language support across the application
   - Improved language detection and handling
   - Enhanced multilingual prompts
4. **User Experience**:
   - Focus on functionality rather than exposing model details
   - Simplified UI with clear language options
   - Consistent experience across different tools
5. **API Integration**:
   - Adapted to model-specific requirements (e.g., Gemini's lack of system role support)
   - Standardized API response format
   - Improved error handling
