   - Updated all toast calls in the Mock Interview page to use the correct pattern
   - Removed unused imports to clean up the code

### Interview Prep Statistics Implementation - March 14, 2025

We have implemented a statistics section for the Interview Prep feature:

1. **API Route for Statistics**:

   - Created a new API route at `/api/interview-prep/statistics` to fetch user statistics
   - The route retrieves mock interview count, questions practiced, saved questions, and average score
   - Implemented proper authentication checks and error handling

2. **Dynamic Statistics Display**:

   - Updated the Interview Prep page to fetch and display real-time statistics
   - Added loading states with skeleton UI for better user experience

   - Added a dynamic call-to-action button that changes based on user activity

   - Enhanced the UI with responsive design for all screen sizes

### Interview Prep Feature Refinements - March 14, 2025

We have made several refinements to the Interview Preparation feature:

1. **Feature Ordering and User Flow**:

   - Reordered the features on the main Interview Prep page to place the Interview Prep Plan as the first activity
   - Established a logical flow: Plan → Mock Interview → Question Library
   - This change emphasizes the importance of preparation and planning before practice

2. **Premium User Testing**:

   - Modified the `checkPremiumStatus` function to treat all authenticated users as premium users for testing purposes
   - This allows for comprehensive testing of premium features before implementing actual subscription checks

3. **Restored Free Plan Features**:
   - Ensured all core interview prep plan features are available to free users
   - These include job detail input, LLM adaptation of interview prep plans, question generation, and PDF export

### Interview Prep Feature Implementation - March 14, 2025

We have successfully implemented the Interview Preparation feature with the following components:

1. **Database Schema Updates**:

   - Added new models to the Prisma schema: `InterviewSession`, `InterviewQuestion`, `InterviewResponse`, `QuestionLibrary`, and `UserSavedQuestion`
   - Updated the User model with new relations for the Interview Prep feature

2. **API Routes**:

   - Created the Mock Interview API routes:
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview` - For starting sessions and submitting responses
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview/[sessionId]` - For retrieving and ending sessions
     - `/api/interview-prep/mock-interview/evaluate` - For evaluating interview responses
   - Created the Question Library API routes:
     - `/api/interview-prep/questions` - For browsing and saving questions
     - `/api/interview-prep/questions/[id]` - For managing individual saved questions

3. **UI Components**:
   - Created the main Interview Prep page as an entry point to all features
   - Implemented the Mock Interview feature:

     - Added a summary page to display session results
   - Implemented the Question Library feature:
     - Created the questions browsing page with filtering and pagination

All components are designed with a mobile-first approach and follow the existing UI patterns of the application.
