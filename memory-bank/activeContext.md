5. Develop the Interview Prep App as a companion feature

### ApplyRight Implementation - June 14, 2023

We've successfully implemented the core components of the ApplyRight feature:

1. **Document Parsing**: Created a utility for extracting text from various document formats (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) using:

   - mammoth for Word documents (DOC, DOCX)
   - react-pdftotext for PDF documents
   - Native File API for text files

2. **User Interface Components**:

   - `FileUpload`: Handles file uploads and document parsing
   - `JobDescription`: Allows users to input job descriptions
   - `ResumePreview`: Displays the transformed resume
   - `CoverLetterPreview`: Displays the generated cover letter
   - `HowItWorks`: Explains the ApplyRight process
   - `FeaturesSection`: Showcases the features of ApplyRight
   - `PricingSection`: Displays pricing tiers and handles premium upgrades

3. **API Integration**: Implemented the API route for transforming resumes using the Gemini API.

4. **User Flow**:
   - Upload resume (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT)
   - Optionally add job description
   - Transform resume
   - View and download transformed resume and cover letter

### Known Issues and Limitations

1. **PDF Support**: PDF parsing is implemented using react-pdftotext with dynamic imports to ensure it only runs on the client side. This approach avoids server-side rendering issues with the PDF.js dependency.

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add more export format options
   - Enhance the resume transformation algorithm
   - Implement premium features for authenticated users

## Recent Changes

- Implemented PDF support in the ApplyRight feature using react-pdftotext with dynamic imports
- Updated the document parser to handle PDF files on the client side only
- Updated the FileUpload component to accept PDF files
- Updated the UI to reflect PDF support
- Successfully tested the feature with PDF files
- Enhanced the download functionality to generate professional PDF documents instead of plain text files
- Added proper PDF formatting with headers, footers, and intelligent text layout
- Updated UI text to clearly indicate PDF download options

## Next Steps

1. **PDF Support**: Investigate and implement a more robust solution for PDF parsing.
2. **Premium Features**: Implement the premium features for authenticated users.
3. **Export Options**: Add more export format options (DOCX, PDF).
4. **User Testing**: Gather feedback from users and make improvements.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

- **Document Parsing**: We've decided to temporarily disable PDF support to ensure the feature works reliably. We'll need to investigate a more robust solution for PDF parsing in the future.
- **API Integration**: We're using the Gemini API for resume transformation, which provides good results but may need fine-tuning for specific use cases.
- **User Experience**: We've designed the UI to guide users through the process with clear steps and feedback.
- **Error Handling**: We've implemented comprehensive error handling to provide clear feedback to users when issues occur.
