# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus (2024-03-01)

The current focus is on enhancing the Interview Questions Generator by implementing two additional features: evaluation tips and scoring rubrics. These features were specified in the project brief but had not yet been implemented. The evaluation tips provide guidance on how to evaluate responses to each interview question, while the scoring rubric offers a comprehensive framework for scoring all responses. These additions make the Interview Questions Generator a more complete and valuable tool for users conducting interviews.

Previously, the focus was on integrating the Interview Questions Generator into the main application. We've replaced the 2Do Task Manager card on the home page with the Interview Questions Generator card, making this feature more accessible to users directly from the home page. This change helps highlight the new functionality and provides users with easier access to this tool.

Previously, the focus was on improving the UI readability by changing all grey/silver text to black throughout the application. This change was implemented across multiple pages and components to ensure consistent readability and better user experience. We've updated the global CSS file to modify default text colors and then systematically updated individual components where specific grey text classes were used.

Previously, the focus was on enhancing the application's analytics capabilities by adding Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights. This will help track user interactions, monitor performance metrics, and identify areas for improvement. We've successfully integrated both Vercel Analytics and Speed Insights into the application's root layout to ensure all pages are tracked. We've also fixed an import path issue with the SpeedInsights component, changing it from '@vercel/speed-insights/next' to '@vercel/speed-insights/react'.

Previous focus was on improving the JD Developer component's user experience and fixing template filtering issues. We've enhanced the template guide with better styling and clearer instructions about required fields. We've also fixed an issue where templates were appearing in both the templates list and the saved job descriptions list by improving the filtering logic in the API endpoints. Most recently, we've improved the loading state UI for the templates tab to provide a smoother and more consistent user experience.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

- Consistent text colors across the application create a more cohesive user experience
- Further accessibility improvements could be considered, such as increasing contrast ratios
- Vercel Analytics provides valuable insights into user behavior and can help identify areas for improvement
- Speed Insights helps track Web Vitals and other performance metrics to ensure a good user experience
- Analytics data should be regularly monitored to identify trends and make data-driven decisions
- Next.js App Router requires a specific directory structure with page.tsx files in their respective directories
- Proper page structure is essential for navigation to work correctly
- Loading states should be consistent across the application for a better user experience
- Minimum loading times can improve perceived performance by preventing brief flashes of loading states
- The template guide should clearly indicate which fields are required vs. optional
- The filtering logic for templates vs. saved JDs should be robust and handle edge cases
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
- The LLM prompt for job description generation may need adjustments to handle missing fields
- The Google OAuth configuration needs to be properly set up in the Google Cloud Console
- Authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs need to be configured correctly
