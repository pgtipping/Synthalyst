# Active Context (2024-03-01)

## Current Focus (2024-03-01)

The current focus is on improving the overall site structure and navigation to ensure a better user experience. We've fixed 404 errors in the navigation by properly structuring the pages according to Next.js App Router conventions. We've also cleaned up the codebase by removing old page files that were no longer needed.

Previous focus was on improving the JD Developer component's user experience and fixing template filtering issues. We've enhanced the template guide with better styling and clearer instructions about required fields. We've also fixed an issue where templates were appearing in both the templates list and the saved job descriptions list by improving the filtering logic in the API endpoints. Most recently, we've improved the loading state UI for the templates tab to provide a smoother and more consistent user experience.

We've also enhanced the authentication system by adding Google OAuth integration to the application. We've successfully implemented Google sign-in buttons on both the sign-in and sign-up pages, and fixed environment configuration issues.

We've successfully implemented and fixed tests for these endpoints using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern. The mock Prisma client has been enhanced to support all required models, including JobDescription, Task, and User.

## Next Steps (2024-03-01)

1. Verify that all navigation links work correctly throughout the application
2. Consider enhancing the UI of the About, Services, and Contact pages
3. Test the template filtering to ensure templates only appear in the templates list
4. Verify that saved job descriptions don't include templates
5. Consider adding sample templates for new users to get started quickly
6. Monitor the Vercel deployment to ensure all fixes are working properly
7. Test the JD Developer form to ensure it works without education, experience, and certifications
8. Consider adding loading states for salary generation in JD Developer
9. Complete test coverage for JD Developer
10. Test the Google authentication flow in the development environment

## Active Decisions (2024-03-01)

- Restructured pages to follow Next.js App Router conventions for better maintainability and to fix 404 errors
- Cleaned up old page files to keep the codebase clean and avoid confusion
- Implemented a minimum loading time for the templates tab to ensure a smoother user experience
- Enhanced the loading UI to be more consistent with the Saved JDs tab
- Decided against including sample templates in the codebase, instead providing a comprehensive guide for users to create their own templates
- Using double-checking of parsed content to ensure proper filtering of templates vs. saved JDs
- Enhancing the template guide with clear instructions and better UI to improve user experience
- Making education, experience, and certifications optional in the JD Developer form
- Using Google OAuth as an additional authentication method alongside email/password
- Maintaining consistent UI patterns across authentication methods
- Ensuring clear environment configuration with proper comments
- Using a standardized mock Prisma client pattern for all API tests
- Ensuring consistent error handling across all API endpoints
- Maintaining the mock Prisma client to stay in sync with the actual Prisma schema

## Considerations (2024-03-01)

- Next.js App Router requires a specific directory structure with page.tsx files in their respective directories
- Proper page structure is essential for navigation to work correctly
- Loading states should be consistent across the application for a better user experience
- Minimum loading times can improve perceived performance by preventing brief flashes of loading states
- The template guide should clearly indicate which fields are required vs. optional
- The filtering logic for templates vs. saved JDs should be robust and handle edge cases
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
- The LLM prompt for job description generation may need adjustments to handle missing fields
- The Google OAuth configuration needs to be properly set up in the Google Cloud Console
- Authorized JavaScript origins and redirect URIs need to be configured correctly
- Environment variables need to be set correctly for both development and production
- The mock Prisma client should be kept in sync with the actual Prisma schema
- We should consider adding more comprehensive validation tests for API endpoints
- Error handling should be thoroughly tested for all API endpoints
