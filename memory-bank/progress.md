# Progress - March 15, 2025

## What Works

### Core Features

- User authentication with NextAuth.js
- User profile management
- Dashboard with activity overview
- Blog with content management
- Document management system
- Template system for various document types
- Task management system
- Training plan creator
- Knowledge GPT with multilingual support
- Learning Content Creator with multilingual support
- Model optimization with tiered approach for cost efficiency

### Technical Infrastructure

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- API routes for all features
- Error handling and logging
- Authentication and authorization
- Database migrations and seeding
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## What's Left to Build

### Features in Progress

- Analytics dashboard for usage tracking
- Advanced search functionality
- Notification system
- User feedback collection system
- Collaborative features for team workspaces

### Planned Features

- Integration with external learning management systems
- Export functionality for various formats
- Mobile app version
- API for third-party integrations
- Advanced admin dashboard

## Current Status

### Recently Completed

- Implemented model optimization for Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator
- Added multilingual support to both features
- Created a model router service for dynamic model selection
- Updated database schema to support language and model tracking for internal analytics
- Enhanced UI with language selection and improved content display
- Removed all model-specific information from user-facing interfaces

### In Progress

- Testing the model optimization implementation
- Collecting user feedback on multilingual support
- Implementing analytics for internal model usage tracking
- Ensuring consistent "AI-powered" branding without revealing specific models

### Known Issues

- Need to add proper error handling for AI API integrations
- Need to implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Need to optimize prompts for different AI capabilities
- Need to ensure no model-specific information is leaked to the UI

### UI Guidelines

- Present a unified "AI-powered" experience to users
- Never display which specific models are being used
- Focus on the quality of outputs rather than technical implementation details
- Use generic terms like "AI model" instead of specific model names

## What Works (March 15, 2025)

- Knowledge GPT and Learning Content Creator pages are fully functional
- Model optimization has been implemented with generic model types
- Language selection is working across the platform
- UI has been updated to remove model information
- API integration with both OpenAI and Google AI is working properly

## What's Left to Build (March 15, 2025)

- Backend model routing logic based on task complexity
- Cost optimization features for model selection
- Enhanced error handling for API calls
- User preference settings for language selection
- Analytics for model usage tracking

## Current Status (March 15, 2025)

The platform is stable and functional with the following features:

1. **Knowledge GPT**:

   - Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

2. **Learning Content Creator**:

   - Uses GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

3. **Model Router**:
   - Implements generic model types (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL and LEARNING_MODEL)
   - Supports language selection
   - Ready for future enhancements for task-based model selection

## Known Issues (March 15, 2025)

- No current issues with the implemented changes
- Future work needed on backend model routing logic
- Need to implement analytics for model usage tracking
