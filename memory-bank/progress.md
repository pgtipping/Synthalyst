# Progress - March 15, 2025

## What Works

### Core Features

- User authentication with NextAuth.js
- User profile management
- Dashboard with activity overview
- Blog with content management
- Document management system
- Template system for various document types
- Task management system
- Training plan creator
- Knowledge GPT with multilingual support
- Learning Content Creator with multilingual support
- Model optimization with tiered approach for cost efficiency

### Technical Infrastructure

- Next.js 14 with App Router
- Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- API routes for all features
- Error handling and logging
- Authentication and authorization
- Database migrations and seeding
- Testing with Jest and React Testing Library
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions

## What's Left to Build

### Features in Progress

- Analytics dashboard for usage tracking
- Advanced search functionality
- Notification system
- User feedback collection system
- Collaborative features for team workspaces

### Planned Features

- Integration with external learning management systems
- Export functionality for various formats
- Mobile app version
- API for third-party integrations
- Advanced admin dashboard

## Current Status

### Recently Completed

- Implemented model optimization for Knowledge GPT and Learning Creator
- Added multilingual support to both features
- Created a model router service for dynamic model selection
- Updated database schema to support language and model tracking for internal analytics
- Enhanced UI with language selection and improved content display
- Removed all model-specific information from user-facing interfaces

### In Progress

- Testing the model optimization implementation
- Collecting user feedback on multilingual support
- Implementing analytics for internal model usage tracking
- Ensuring consistent "AI-powered" branding without revealing specific models

### Known Issues

- Need to add proper error handling for AI API integrations
- Need to implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Need to optimize prompts for different AI capabilities
- Need to ensure no model-specific information is leaked to the UI

### UI Guidelines

- Present a unified "AI-powered" experience to users
- Never display which specific models are being used
- Focus on the quality of outputs rather than technical implementation details
- Use generic terms like "AI model" instead of specific model names

## What Works (March 15, 2025)

- **Core Platform**:

  - User authentication and authorization
  - Dashboard and navigation
  - Tools page with all available tools
  - Settings page for user preferences

- **Knowledge GPT**:

  - Question submission and answer generation
  - Language selection with proper API integration
  - Previous questions history
  - Responsive design for all devices

- **Learning Content Creator**:

  - Topic submission and content generation
  - Language selection with proper API integration
  - Previous topics history
  - Responsive design for all devices

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Generic model types for UI (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL, LEARNING_MODEL)
  - Tiered model selection based on task complexity
  - Language support standardization
  - Cost-efficient model routing
  - Model-specific API adaptations (e.g., Gemini system message handling)

## What's Left to Build (March 15, 2025)

- **Analytics Dashboard**:

  - Usage statistics
  - Performance metrics
  - Cost tracking

- **Advanced Settings**:

  - User preferences for model selection
  - API usage limits
  - Custom prompt templates

- **Content Management**:

  - Export/import functionality
  - Content organization
  - Tagging and categorization

- **Collaboration Features**:
  - Shared workspaces
  - Team collaboration
  - Content sharing

## Current Status (March 15, 2025)

The platform is stable and functional with the following features:

1. **Knowledge GPT**:

   - Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

2. **Learning Content Creator**:

   - Uses GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

3. **Model Router**:
   - Implements generic model types (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL and LEARNING_MODEL)
   - Supports language selection
   - Ready for future enhancements for task-based model selection

The platform is functional with core features working well. Recent improvements to the language selector and model optimization have enhanced the user experience and backend efficiency. The focus is now on refining the existing features and implementing the remaining components.

Fixed a critical issue with Gemini API integration where system messages were causing errors. Implemented a solution that combines system messages with user messages for Gemini models.

## Known Issues (March 15, 2025)

- No current issues with the implemented changes
- Future work needed on backend model routing logic
- Need to implement analytics for model usage tracking
- Need to implement proper error handling for API failures
- Performance optimization needed for large content generation
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement in some areas
- Need to add more comprehensive testing
