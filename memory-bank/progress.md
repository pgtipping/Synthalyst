### Known Issues

- Need to complete Prisma migration for the EmailLog model

### UI Guidelines

- Present a unified "AI-powered" experience to users
- Never display which specific models are being used
- Focus on the quality of outputs rather than technical implementation details
- Use generic terms like "AI model" instead of specific model names
- Ensure consistent button heights and alignment for better mobile experience
- Provide clear visual distinction between different knowledge domains
- Include informative tips for users about how to interact with each domain
- Use responsive design for all components, especially admin interfaces
- Implement consistent styling across all admin pages
- Ensure all SelectItem components have non-empty values to prevent errors
- Provide fallback UI states when data is missing or loading
