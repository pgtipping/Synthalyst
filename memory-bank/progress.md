- Updated database schema to support language and model tracking for internal analytics
- Enhanced UI with language selection and improved content display
- Removed all model-specific information from user-facing interfaces
- Added web search capability to Knowledge GPT for up-to-date information
- Updated system prompts to include current information
- Implemented Google Custom Search API integration
- Improved Knowledge GPT with smart web search detection to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Enhanced text formatting in Knowledge GPT responses to properly display bold text and lists
- Updated loading animation to use three dots instead of spinning icon for better UX
- Added client-side formatting to properly render content with HTML formatting
- Added web search toggle button to Knowledge GPT to let users control when web search is used
- Updated API to respect user preference for web search usage
- Modified system prompt to indicate when web search is being used

### In Progress

- Testing the model optimization implementation
- Collecting user feedback on multilingual support
- Implementing analytics for internal model usage tracking
- Ensuring consistent "AI-powered" branding without revealing specific models
- Refining web search integration for better results

### Known Issues

- Need to add proper error handling for AI API integrations
- Need to implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Need to optimize prompts for different AI capabilities
- Need to ensure no model-specific information is leaked to the UI
- Web search requires Google Custom Search API key and Search Engine ID configuration

### UI Guidelines

- Present a unified "AI-powered" experience to users
- Never display which specific models are being used
- Focus on the quality of outputs rather than technical implementation details
- Use generic terms like "AI model" instead of specific model names

## What Works (March 16, 2025)

- **Core Platform**:

  - User authentication and authorization
  - Dashboard and navigation
  - Tools page with all available tools
  - Settings page for user preferences

- **Knowledge GPT**:

  - Question submission and answer generation
  - Language selection with proper API integration
  - Web search integration for up-to-date information
  - Previous questions history
  - Responsive design for all devices

- **Learning Content Creator**:

  - Topic submission and content generation
  - Language selection with proper API integration
  - Previous topics history
  - Responsive design for all devices

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Generic model types for UI (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL, LEARNING_MODEL)
  - Tiered model selection based on task complexity
  - Language support standardization
  - Cost-efficient model routing
  - Model-specific API adaptations (e.g., Gemini system message handling)

## What's Left to Build (March 16, 2025)

- **Analytics Dashboard**:

  - Usage statistics
  - Performance metrics
  - Cost tracking

- **Advanced Settings**:

  - User preferences for model selection
  - API usage limits
  - Custom prompt templates

- **Content Management**:

  - Export/import functionality
  - Content organization
  - Tagging and categorization

- **Collaboration Features**:
  - Shared workspaces
  - Team collaboration
  - Content sharing

## Current Status (March 16, 2025)

The platform is stable and functional with the following features:

1. **Knowledge GPT**:

   - Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model
   - Integrates web search for up-to-date information
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

2. **Learning Content Creator**:

   - Uses GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

3. **Model Router**:
   - Implements generic model types (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL and LEARNING_MODEL)
   - Supports language selection
   - Ready for future enhancements for task-based model selection

The platform is functional with core features working well. Recent improvements to the language selector, model optimization, and web search integration have enhanced the user experience and backend efficiency. The focus is now on refining the existing features and implementing the remaining components.

Fixed a critical issue with Gemini API integration where system messages were causing errors. Implemented a solution that combines system messages with user messages for Gemini models.

Added web search capability to Knowledge GPT to provide up-to-date information, particularly for current events and facts. This ensures that users receive accurate information even when the model's training data is outdated.

## Known Issues (March 16, 2025)

- Web search requires Google Custom Search API key and Search Engine ID configuration
- Future work needed on backend model routing logic
- Need to implement analytics for model usage tracking
- Need to implement proper error handling for API failures
- Performance optimization needed for large content generation
- Mobile responsiveness needs improvement in some areas
- Need to add more comprehensive testing
