## Current Status

The application now has fully functional Interview Preparation and ApplyRight resume optimization features. Both features have been enhanced with streaming responses to avoid timeout issues in production, and Redis caching has been implemented to improve performance and reduce API costs.

The ApplyRight feature now provides high-quality resume transformations for both free and premium users, with premium users differentiated through add-on services rather than core quality. The streaming implementation ensures that users see content as it's generated, providing a more interactive and engaging experience while avoiding timeout issues.

The Interview Preparation feature includes an Interview Prep Plan generator, a Mock Interview system with audio capabilities, a Question Library, and a User Statistics dashboard. The features are arranged in a logical flow that guides users through the interview preparation process.

Users can create personalized interview preparation plans based on job details, practice with AI-generated questions in mock interviews, receive feedback on their responses, and save questions for later review. The Mock Interview feature now supports both text and voice responses, with text-to-speech functionality for reading questions aloud. The statistics dashboard provides users with a clear overview of their progress, showing the number of mock interviews completed, questions practiced, questions saved, and their average score.

We've recently fixed the Gateway Timeout (504) errors in both the Interview Prep Plan generation and ApplyRight resume transformation by implementing streaming responses, Redis caching, and robust error handling. The system now uses high-quality Gemini models while maintaining responsiveness through streaming rather than compromising on quality.

We've also integrated audio components into the Mock Interview feature, allowing users to record their responses and have questions read aloud. The audio recording component has been significantly improved with enhanced audio quality settings (disabled noise reduction, higher sample rate, optimized audio format) and better UI feedback (real-time status messages, color coding, button animations). We've also added an Audio Components Demo page for testing and showcasing the audio capabilities of the application.

The features are designed with a mobile-first approach and follow the existing UI patterns of the application. All components are responsive and provide a consistent user experience across different devices.

## Known Issues

- The build process occasionally encounters permission errors with the `.next/trace` file
- Some components have unused imports that need to be cleaned up
- Prisma database connection issues in the production environment need to be resolved
- The statistics API currently returns empty values as a workaround for database connection issues
- Prisma client generation issues on Windows (EPERM errors)
- Browser compatibility variations for audio recording
- Permission handling needs to be tested across different devices
- PDF generation may have issues in some production environments
