### In Progress

- Setting up SendGrid Inbound Parse for email handling

- Testing the email processing workflow from external sources
- Completing the Prisma migration for the EmailLog model
- Testing the unified email service implementation
- Collecting user feedback on the admin dashboard
- Testing the model optimization implementation
- Collecting user feedback on multilingual support
- Implementing analytics for internal model usage tracking
- Ensuring consistent "AI-powered" branding without revealing specific models
- Refining web search integration for better results

- Implementing a systematic approach to error detection and resolution across all admin pages
- Monitoring contact form submissions to detect and resolve issues quickly

### Known Issues

- SendGrid Inbound Parse webhook needs to be properly configured to forward emails to the application
- Need to verify the webhook endpoint is correctly processing incoming emails
- Need to ensure proper MX records are set up for the domain
- Need to complete Prisma migration for the EmailLog model
- Need to add more comprehensive testing for the email service
- Need to add proper error handling for AI API integrations
- Need to implement fallback mechanisms for API failures
- Need to optimize prompts for different AI capabilities
- Need to ensure no model-specific information is leaked to the UI
- Web search requires Google Custom Search API key and Search Engine ID configuration
- Medical Knowledge Assistant treats conversational phrases as new medical queries
- Some TypeScript errors still exist in test files that need to be addressed
- Port 3001 sometimes remains in use after server shutdown, requiring manual termination
- Need to ensure proper separation of client and server components in Next.js, especially regarding metadata exports
- Need to be careful with library version updates, particularly for packages like lru-cache where API changes can cause build failures
- BigInt serialization is required for all API responses that might contain database IDs

### UI Guidelines

- Present a unified "AI-powered" experience to users
- Never display which specific models are being used
- Focus on the quality of outputs rather than technical implementation details
- Use generic terms like "AI model" instead of specific model names
- Ensure consistent button heights and alignment for better mobile experience
- Provide clear visual distinction between different knowledge domains
- Include informative tips for users about how to interact with each domain
- Use responsive design for all components, especially admin interfaces
- Implement consistent styling across all admin pages
- Ensure all SelectItem components have non-empty values to prevent errors
- Provide fallback UI states when data is missing or loading
- Use conditional rendering for UI elements that depend on asynchronously loaded data
- Implement null checks and default values to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- Hide the main site header on admin pages for a cleaner interface
- Use a sidebar-only navigation approach for desktop admin pages
- Implement a mobile-only top bar with essential controls for smaller screens
- Display detailed error messages to users when form submissions fail
- Implement graceful degradation for features to succeed even if some parts fail

### Error Handling Guidelines

- Use nested try-catch blocks to handle different types of errors separately
- Separate database errors from email sending errors and other API errors
- Make features optional when they depend on external services or database models
- Enhance error messages with detailed information for better debugging
- Implement graceful degradation so features can succeed even if some parts fail
- Add checks to verify if database models exist before attempting to use them
- Use TypeScript to ensure type safety and prevent runtime errors
- Serialize BigInt values to strings before including them in JSON responses
- Provide fallback UI states when data is missing or loading
- Use conditional rendering for UI elements that depend on asynchronously loaded data
- Implement null checks and default values to prevent "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
