## Current Issues

- TypeScript errors in test files (2025-03-07 12:47:09)
  - Several test files have TypeScript errors related to Next.js 15.2.0 compatibility
  - Most errors are in the API route test files, particularly in the training plan and 2Do task manager tests
  - Common error patterns include:
    - Incorrect parameter types for API route handlers (Promise<{ id: string }> vs { id: string })
    - Missing type definitions for mock objects
    - Implicit 'any' types in test files
    - Incompatible mock implementations for NextRequest
  - These errors don't affect the runtime functionality but should be fixed for proper type safety
  - Priority: Medium (fix during the next testing-focused sprint)
