## Current Status (March 16, 2025)

The platform is stable and functional with the following features:

1. **Knowledge GPT**:

   - Uses Gemini 1.5 Flash-8B as the primary model
   - Integrates web search for up-to-date information
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI
   - Includes domain selection for specialized knowledge areas
   - Medical domain with PubMed integration for evidence-based information
   - Properly aligned UI elements for better user experience

2. **Learning Content Creator**:

   - Uses GPT-4o-Mini as the primary model
   - Supports multiple languages
   - No longer displays model information in the UI

3. **Model Router**:
   - Implements generic model types (KNOWLEDGE_MODEL and LEARNING_MODEL)
   - Supports language selection
   - Ready for future enhancements for task-based model selection

The platform is functional with core features working well. Recent improvements to the language selector, model optimization, and web search integration have enhanced the user experience and backend efficiency. The addition of the Medical Knowledge Assistant with PubMed integration provides specialized, evidence-based information for health-related queries. The focus is now on refining the existing features and implementing the remaining components.

Fixed a critical issue with Gemini API integration where system messages were causing errors. Implemented a solution that combines system messages with user messages for Gemini models.

Added web search capability to Knowledge GPT to provide up-to-date information, particularly for current events and facts. This ensures that users receive accurate information even when the model's training data is outdated.

Integrated PubMed API to provide evidence-based medical information with proper citations and evidence grading, enhancing the value of the Knowledge GPT feature for health-related queries.

Fixed UI alignment issues with language and domain selectors to ensure a consistent and professional appearance on both desktop and mobile devices.

Added clear user guidance in the tips section to inform users about the limitations of the Medical Knowledge Assistant regarding conversational phrases.
