- Medical Knowledge Assistant treats conversational phrases as new medical queries
- Some TypeScript errors still exist in test files that need to be addressed
- Port 3001 sometimes remains in use after server shutdown, requiring manual termination
- Need to ensure proper separation of client and server components in Next.js, especially regarding metadata exports
- Need to be careful with library version updates, particularly for packages like lru-cache where API changes can cause build failures

## In Progress

### Deployment Issues (March 18, 2025)

- **Component Resolution**: Despite implementing multiple solutions for component path resolution during build time, including:

  - Webpack alias configuration
  - Component copying scripts
