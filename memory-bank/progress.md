## Current Status

The application now has a fully functional Interview Preparation feature, which includes an Interview Prep Plan generator, a Mock Interview system, a Question Library, and a User Statistics dashboard. The features are arranged in a logical flow that guides users through the interview preparation process.

Users can create personalized interview preparation plans based on job details, practice with AI-generated questions in mock interviews, receive feedback on their responses, and save questions for later review. The statistics dashboard provides users with a clear overview of their progress, showing the number of mock interviews completed, questions practiced, questions saved, and their average score.

The feature is designed with a mobile-first approach and follows the existing UI patterns of the application. All components are responsive and provide a consistent user experience across different devices. The statistics section includes proper loading states, authentication handling, and fallback UI for users with no activity.

## Known Issues

- The build process occasionally encounters permission errors with the `.next/trace` file
- Some components have unused imports that need to be cleaned up
- TypeScript linter warnings about possibly null values in the statistics section
