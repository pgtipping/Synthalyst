## Current Status

The application now has a fully functional Interview Preparation feature, which includes an Interview Prep Plan generator, a Mock Interview system with audio capabilities, a Question Library, and a User Statistics dashboard. The features are arranged in a logical flow that guides users through the interview preparation process.

Users can create personalized interview preparation plans based on job details, practice with AI-generated questions in mock interviews, receive feedback on their responses, and save questions for later review. The Mock Interview feature now supports both text and voice responses, with text-to-speech functionality for reading questions aloud. The statistics dashboard provides users with a clear overview of their progress, showing the number of mock interviews completed, questions practiced, questions saved, and their average score.

We've recently integrated audio components into the Mock Interview feature, allowing users to record their responses and have questions read aloud. The audio recording component has been significantly improved with enhanced audio quality settings (disabled noise reduction, higher sample rate, optimized audio format) and better UI feedback (real-time status messages, color coding, button animations). We've also added an Audio Components Demo page for testing and showcasing the audio capabilities of the application.

The feature is designed with a mobile-first approach and follows the existing UI patterns of the application. All components are responsive and provide a consistent user experience across different devices. The statistics section includes proper loading states, authentication handling, and fallback UI for users with no activity.

The application is functional with core features implemented. Recent improvements to the audio recording system have significantly enhanced reliability and user experience. The system now supports both local filesystem storage for development and AWS S3 storage for production, with a clean abstraction layer that makes it easy to switch between them.

Database integration for audio recordings has been implemented, allowing for better organization and tracking of user recordings. The user interface for audio recording has been improved with a progress bar, timer, and clear status indicators.

## Known Issues
