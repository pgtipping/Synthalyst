## Recent Updates - 2024-03-03

### Fixed Vercel Build Errors

- Fixed critical Vercel build error related to useSearchParams() not being wrapped in a Suspense boundary
- Modified the Training Plan page to properly wrap the client component in a Suspense boundary
- Created additional page components with proper Suspense boundaries for all components using useSearchParams()
- Implemented consistent loading UI for all Suspense fallbacks to improve user experience during loading states
- Ensured all pages with client-side navigation hooks follow Next.js 15.2.0 requirements

### Next Steps

- Test the deployment to verify the fix resolves the Vercel build error
- Standardize the approach for all pages using client-side navigation hooks
- Create a reusable Suspense wrapper component to maintain consistency across the application
- Document the pattern in the project guidelines for future development

## Recent Updates - 2024-03-04

### Standardized Client Component Suspense Boundaries

- Created a reusable `ClientComponentWrapper` component to provide consistent Suspense boundaries for client components
- Implemented a standardized loading UI with spinner and customizable loading text
- Updated all pages using navigation hooks to use the new wrapper component:
  - Training Plan page
  - Auth pages (signin, signup, error)
  - JD Developer page
- Documented the pattern in `.cursorrules` for future development
- Ensured all components comply with Next.js 15.2.0+ requirements

### Next Steps

- Test the deployment to confirm that all fixes resolve the Vercel build errors
- Extend the wrapper component to support different loading UI variants if needed
- Create additional utility components for other common patterns
- Implement automated tests to verify proper Suspense boundary implementation

### Enhanced ClientComponentWrapper with Advanced Features

- Improved the `ClientComponentWrapper` component with multiple loading UI variants:
  - **Default**: Centered spinner with text below, suitable for most content areas
  - **Minimal**: Inline spinner with small text, good for smaller UI elements
  - **Fullscreen**: Full-screen overlay with backdrop blur, ideal for initial page loads
  - **Skeleton**: Content placeholder with pulse animation, best for content-heavy sections
- Created a higher-order component (HOC) version called `withClientComponent` for a more functional approach:
  ```tsx
  const WrappedComponent = withClientComponent(MyClientComponent, {
    loadingText: "Loading component...",
    variant: "minimal",
  });
  ```
- Added a `compose` utility function for combining multiple HOCs together:
  ```tsx
  const EnhancedComponent = compose(
    withAnalytics,
    withErrorBoundary,
    withClientComponent
  )(BaseComponent);
  ```
- Implemented comprehensive test coverage for all new components and utilities:
  - Unit tests for the `ClientComponentWrapper` component
  - Unit tests for the `LoadingUI` component with all variants
  - Unit tests for the `withClientComponent` HOC
  - Tests for prop preservation and display name handling
- Created detailed documentation in `nextjs-app/docs/client-component-wrapper.md`
- Updated the README in the wrappers directory to reflect the new features
- Created a test example page at `/examples/client-wrapper-test` to demonstrate the functionality

### Next Steps

- Consider adding error boundary support to handle errors in client components
- Explore creating specialized variants for specific sections of the application
- Implement automated detection of navigation hooks to suggest wrapping with ClientComponentWrapper
- Add the pattern to the project's ESLint rules to enforce proper usage
