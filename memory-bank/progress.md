## Current Status

The application now has a fully functional Interview Preparation feature, which includes an Interview Prep Plan generator, a Mock Interview system, a Question Library, and a User Statistics dashboard. The features are arranged in a logical flow that guides users through the interview preparation process.

Users can create personalized interview preparation plans based on job details, practice with AI-generated questions in mock interviews, receive feedback on their responses, and save questions for later review. The statistics dashboard provides users with a clear overview of their progress, showing the number of mock interviews completed, questions practiced, questions saved, and their average score.

We've recently fixed issues with the statistics API by implementing robust error handling that returns accurate empty statistics when a user has no activity or when database connection issues occur. We've also updated the breadcrumbs navigation to provide better context for users about where they are in the application's structure, with a consistent path of Home > Tools > Interview Prep.

The feature is designed with a mobile-first approach and follows the existing UI patterns of the application. All components are responsive and provide a consistent user experience across different devices. The statistics section includes proper loading states, authentication handling, and fallback UI for users with no activity.

## Known Issues

- The build process occasionally encounters permission errors with the `.next/trace` file
- Some components have unused imports that need to be cleaned up
- Prisma database connection issues in the production environment need to be resolved
- The statistics API currently returns empty values as a workaround for database connection issues
