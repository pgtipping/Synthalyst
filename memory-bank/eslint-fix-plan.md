# ESLint Error Resolution Plan - 2025-03-05

## Overview

This document outlines a systematic approach to address ESLint errors in the Synthalyst codebase. The goal is to improve code quality, maintainability, and prevent future issues.

## Current Status

The codebase currently has numerous ESLint errors that are being ignored during builds using the `ignoreDuringBuilds: true` setting in `next.config.js`. While this allows successful deployment, it's not a long-term solution.

## Error Categories

Based on the build output, the ESLint errors fall into these categories:

1. **Unused Variables/Imports** (highest frequency)

   - Example: `'schema' is defined but never used`
   - Example: `'PrismaClient' is defined but never used`

2. **TypeScript-specific Issues**

   - Example: `Unexpected any. Specify a different type`
   - Example: `A 'require()' style import is forbidden`

3. **React/JSX Issues**

   - Example: `Do not use an <a> element to navigate to '/admin/contact-submissions/'. Use <Link /> from 'next/link' instead`
   - Example: `Elements with the ARIA role "combobox" must have the following attributes defined: aria-controls,aria-expanded`

4. **Unescaped Entities**
   - Example: `` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;` ``

## Prioritization Strategy

1. **High Priority**

   - Issues in production code (non-test files)
   - Issues that could cause runtime errors
   - Navigation/link issues that affect SEO or accessibility

2. **Medium Priority**

   - Unused variables and imports
   - Type-related issues in non-critical paths

3. **Low Priority**
   - Test file issues
   - Stylistic issues
   - Unescaped entities

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup and Preparation (1 day)

1. **Create ESLint Configuration**

   - Review and update `.eslintrc.js` to ensure rules align with project needs
   - Consider adding specific overrides for test files

2. **Setup Pre-commit Hooks**
   - Implement Husky and lint-staged to prevent new ESLint errors
   - Configure to run ESLint on staged files before commit

### Phase 2: High Priority Fixes (2-3 days)

1. **Navigation/Link Issues**

   - Replace all `<a>` elements with Next.js `<Link>` components
   - Focus on files in `src/app` directory

2. **Accessibility Issues**
   - Add required ARIA attributes to components
   - Focus on form components and interactive elements

### Phase 3: Medium Priority Fixes (3-4 days)

1. **Unused Variables and Imports**

   - Remove or use all unused variables
   - Clean up unnecessary imports
   - Start with core application files

2. **Type-related Issues**
   - Replace `any` types with proper type definitions
   - Fix require-style imports

### Phase 4: Low Priority Fixes (2-3 days)

1. **Test File Cleanup**

   - Address issues in test files
   - Consider adding specific ESLint rules for test files

2. **Stylistic Issues**
   - Fix unescaped entities
   - Address other stylistic concerns

### Phase 5: Finalization (1 day)

1. **Enable ESLint in Build**

   - Set `ignoreDuringBuilds: false` in `next.config.js`
   - Ensure build passes with ESLint enabled

2. **Documentation**
   - Update coding standards documentation
   - Document ESLint configuration and rules

## Maintenance Strategy

1. **Continuous Monitoring**

   - Regular ESLint runs as part of CI/CD
   - Weekly code quality reviews

2. **Developer Guidelines**

   - Update onboarding documentation with ESLint requirements
   - Provide examples of common patterns and solutions

3. **Automation**
   - Consider implementing automatic fixes where possible
   - Integrate with IDE extensions for real-time feedback

## Conclusion

By following this systematic approach, we can address all ESLint errors while minimizing disruption to development. The end result will be a cleaner, more maintainable codebase with fewer potential runtime issues.
