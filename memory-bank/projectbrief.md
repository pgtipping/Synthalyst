# Project Brief - Synthalyst Web App

This app is a Comprehensive Business and Productivity Platform designed to offer a blend of content, digital tools, and AI-powered services to individuals and businesses. It serves as a hub for professional development, productivity enhancement, and business solutions.

It is a mobile first web app that is built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

Though it currently contains HR focused tools, it is NOT a HR focused app. It is a general purpose app that can be used by anyone in any industry.

It is therefore important to design the app with a focus on usability and user experience, and grouping tools by functionality and purpose.

## Purpose & Value Proposition

This app aims to be a one-stop platform for professionals and businesses seeking:

- Expert content and on-demand AI consulting services.
- Custom document and task management solutions.
- AI-powered productivity tools.
- End-to-end digital support from job description drafting to upskilling and productivity optimization.

The platform's fusion of content, commerce, AI-powered tools, and advisory services distinguishes it as a next-generation professional ecosystem.
