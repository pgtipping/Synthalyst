### Fixed Deployment

The TypeScript error in the Interview Questions Generator has been fixed by adding proper type annotations to callback parameters in filter and map functions. The specific error was:

```
[20:04:29.905] Type error: Parameter 'q' implicitly has an 'any' type.
[20:04:29.905]
[20:04:29.905] [0m [90m 180 |[39m parsedResponse[33m.[39mquestions [33m=[39m parsedResponse[33m.[39mquestions[0m
[20:04:29.905] [0m [90m 181 |[39m [33m.[39msplit([32m"\n"[39m)[0m
[20:04:29.905] [0m[31m[1m>[22m[39m[90m 182 |[39m [33m.[39mfilter((q) [33m=>[39m q[33m.[39mtrim())[0m
```

The fix involved adding explicit type annotations to all callback parameters in filter and map functions throughout the file, replacing implicit 'any' types with explicit string and unknown types where appropriate.
