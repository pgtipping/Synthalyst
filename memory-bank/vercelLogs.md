## 2025-03-09 - RESOLVED

Issue: TypeScript could not find declaration file for 'react-pdf-html' module.

Resolution:

- Created a custom type declaration file at `nextjs-app/src/types/react-pdf-html.d.ts`
- Defined the necessary types for the Html component used in TrainingPlanPDF.tsx
- Fixed the build process by providing TypeScript with the missing type information

The issue was caused by the react-pdf-html package's package.json "exports" field not correctly exposing the type definitions. Our custom type declaration file provides the necessary type information for TypeScript to properly type-check the code.

Local build verification:

```
âœ“ Compiled successfully
âœ“ Checking validity of types
```

This fix should resolve the Vercel deployment failure and allow successful builds going forward.
